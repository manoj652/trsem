Antony and Cleopatra.txt:INTRODUCTION
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:William Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra is a play filled with political intrigue, power struggles, war and its consequences, and the plight of two desperately impassioned lovers. Although the play’s action is slightly more complicated
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:than Shakespeare’s other tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra provides an excellent means for students to study the multiple
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:levels of subject matter contained in historical dramas. Teachers of English, history, political science, social studies, geography, mythology, and drama may all benefit from the themes explored in this play. The play, therefore, provides many
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:opportunities for cross-curricular study.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The very mention of the two title characters, Antony and Cleopatra, conjures images of love and the desperate measures
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:taken in pursuit of love. Some have subtitled this play “The Greatest Love Story Ever Told.” Others argue that the play
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:does not depict love, but rather presents a desperate infatuation that destroys a great Roman leader and a noble Egyptian
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:queen. With either interpretation, the play offers a compelling love story that will intrigue students of any age or skill
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:level. Additional themes of divided power, battles with formidable forces, and manipulative enemies and subordinates provide suspense and action. The juxtaposition of love and war is neatly wrapped in Shakespeare’s poetic language, thereby
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:providing a literary work that is compelling and eloquent.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The play at first appears quite complex with inconsistent character behavior, such as Cleopatra’s many mood swings. A
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:sprawling location for the play’s action also complicates events as they occur on three different continents and on the seas
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:that divide these lands. Once character behavior is analyzed and questions are posed concerning motives, many of the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:play’s hidden truths become known and reveal a familiar plot of love and war. Likewise, when the play’s action is visually recreated by acting out scenes, exploring staging, or being a member of an audience enjoying the play or a film version
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:of the play, many text references to geographical location, character motivation, and circumstance gain new meaning.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:After all, plays are written to be performed and observed, not just read.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The following teacher’s guide provides materials to aid teachers in planning multi-layered exercises in text exploration.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The guide provides historical context and a plot synopsis. Following this literary overview, teachers will find activities suggested for student investigation of the play’s content before, during, and after reading. A list of discussion questions for
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:each act is also provided to assist teachers in developing class dialogues concerning the play’s action and thematic content.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:HISTORICAL CONTEXT
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Before one delves into Shakespeare’s play Antony and Cleopatra, it is important to look at the world of the main characters and the events that precede the play’s action.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Approximately two thousand years ago, Cleopatra, “Queen of the Nile,” ruled over Egypt. Her capitol city, Alexandria,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:was considered the greatest cultural and commercial center in the eastern Mediterranean. At the same time, Mark Antony,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Octavius Caesar, and Lepidus were in joint control of the Roman Empire. This triumvirate was the result of Mark
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony’s defeat of Brutus and Cassius, who had assassinated Julius Caesar in 44 b.c. After his victory over the assassins,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Mark Antony joined with Octavius Caesar and Lepidus, men who had remained loyal to Julius Caesar, and formed a joint
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:rulership of the entire Roman Empire. They divided the Empire into three provinces: Octavius Caesar controlled Rome’s
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:European provinces; Lepidus oversaw North Africa; and Mark Antony ruled Rome’s Asian territories.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:As the play begins, it is 41 B.C. and the Roman Empire is expanding its hold on surrounding lands and would soon dominate the whole of their known world. But the Empire is experiencing civil unrest in Italy and faces a considerable threat
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:from Parthia in its eastern provinces, Mark Antony’s territory. From the east, Parthia’s Sextus Pompeius is attempting to
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:take control of the Mediterranean Sea, and the triumvirate faces a formidable force. While Octavius Caesar and Lepidus
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:struggle to keep control in Italy, Mark Antony readies for war with the Parthians.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Although recognized as a brave soldier and eloquent speaker, Mark Antony also has quite the reputation as a ladies man
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:and a great appreciator of a good game and a witty joke. Knowing of Queen Cleopatra’s reputation as a provocative
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:woman who uses her feminine charms, wit, and guile to compensate for being a woman in a traditionally male role, he
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:commences what might be considered social intrigue. While Mark Antony readies his troops for battle, he commands
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Queen Cleopatra to appear before him when he arrives in Cilicia, a country in Asia Minor close to the occupied areas of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Parthia. He plans to provoke Cleopatra by accusing her of aiding Cassius and Brutus in their earlier war against him, but
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra has other plans for Antony.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Determined to win over Antony as she had Julius Caesar, Cleopatra sets sail on the river Cydnus to meet Antony. Her
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:barge is decorated with gleaming gold and propelled by servants rowing silver oars to the sounds of enchanting music.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:She drapes herself in gold robes and is fanned by young boys dressed as cupids. Her ladies-in-waiting, dressed as beautiful mermaids, steer the helm and tend the tackle. As she arrives, large crowds flock to the dock, drawn by the music and
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the exotic perfumes that fill the air. The people rumor that Venus has come to play with the god Bacchus, and it is here
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:that the tale of Antony and Cleopatra begins. Antony is dazzled by Cleopatra’s beauty, wit, and mystique, and, although
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the Parthians are now assembled in Mesopotamia ready to invade Syria, he leaves his wife and his post to depart for
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Alexandria with the insistent and enchanting Queen Cleopatra.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:SYNOPSIS
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:At the play’s opening, Antony, who had abandoned his wife Fulvia and his post in time of war, is indulging in Alexandria’s
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:lavish lifestyle and is fully infatuated by Cleopatra. Then Antony learns from a messenger that his wife and his brother
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Lucius were the cause of the unrest in Italy and had engaged in battle with Octavius Caesar. A new messenger brings the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:unfortunate news that Antony’s wife, Fulvia, died in Greece after having fled Italy (I,i). Antony mourns Fulvia’s death and
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:resolves to leave Cleopatra and return to Rome in order to counter Pompey’s threat in Asia. Cleopatra throws a passionate tantrum when she hears of Antony’s announced departure. She rants and raves to Antony about love and devotion and
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:accuses him of not loving her fully. But as quickly as the tides turn, Cleopatra begs his forgiveness for her outbursts and
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:wishes him victory. Antony departs for Rome, but Cleopatra knows he will return to her (I,iii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:In Rome, Octavius Caesar condemns Antony for being self-indulgent, living a debauched life in Alexandria and neglecting
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:his duties to Rome, but Lepidus is softer in his judgement of Antony. A messenger announces that Sextus Pompeius has gained
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:allegiance from many Romans, and that his allies, the pirates of Menecrates and Menas, threaten the borders of Italy. Octavius
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:and Lepidus hope Antony will return to his position and unite the triumvirate in a combined war against the Parthians (I,iv).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra daydreams of Antony and wonders how he is faring in Rome when Alexas, her minister, brings her a pearl from
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony with Antony’s promise to extend her empire. She boasts of how she enchanted both Julius Caesar and Gnaeus
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Pompey in the past, and to seal her deal with Antony, she sets out to return her love to Antony in a letter (I,v).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:In Sicily, Pompey waits for a sign from the gods that he should make his final move for power over the triumvirate. He
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:counts on Cleopatra distracting Antony from the war and keeping him in Egypt (II,i).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony returns to Rome and is met by a furious Octavius Caesar who accuses Antony of inciting the war in Italy. Antony
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:denies the accusations, blaming Fulvia’s wild nature, but the men are clearly at odds and the unity of the triumvirate is
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:threatened. Agrippa, Octavius’s officer, proposes a remedy to mend the rift between Antony and Octavius. As proof of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony’s devotion to Octavius and Rome, Agrippa proposes that Antony, now a widower, marry Octavius’s newly widowed sister, Octavia. To prove his devotion and seal their alliance, Antony agrees, and Octavius consents to an immediate wedding, before the attack on Pompey (II,iii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:A messenger comes to tell Cleopatra that Antony is to marry Octavia. Enraged, Cleopatra beats the messenger and sends
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:him off to get details of Octavia’s age and beauty (II, v). He later returns and, having learned from his previous encounter
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:with Cleopatra, describes Octavia in the most unflattering way so as to please Cleopatra and escape further beatings.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Satisfied, Cleopatra commends the servant on his graphic descriptions (III,iii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Meanwhile in Italy, after some negotiations, Pompey agrees to peace and invites his past enemies on board his ship for a
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:banquet. Many side discussions ensue concerning the battles, the questionable future of Antony and Octavia, and persistent
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:doubts about a united triumvirate. Lepidus drinks too much and the servants mock him while Menas, a pirate unhappy
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:with the treaty, pulls Pompey aside and offers to cut the throats of Antony, Lepidus, and Caesar. Pompey refuses to conspire with Menas, but Pompey admits that he would have commended him had Menas done the deed without his knowledge (II, vii). Disappointed in Pompey’s missed opportunity for power, Menas later decides to desert Pompey (II,vii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:At the announced defeat of the Parthians, Antony, Octavia, and Caesar have a heartfelt farewell as Antony and Octavia
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:depart for Athens (III,ii). No sooner does the couple arrive in Athens than they learn of new trouble, stirred this time by
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Octavius Caesar. Caesar has broken the treaty and declared war on Pompey. For Octavia’s sake, Antony agrees not to act
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:against Caesar in anger and instead offers to act as mediator. Octavia leaves for Rome to be with her brother, Caesar
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:(III,iv). Later, Antony’s personal assistant, Eros, reports to Enobarbus that Caesar has betrayed Lepidus by first using him
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:in his attack on Pompey and then arresting him for breaking the treaty (III,v). Antony is enraged when he learns of this
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:deceit and demands that Lepidus be deposed and his revenue divided between Caesar and Antony.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Meanwhile, Octavia returns to Rome. Offended that his sister had not been accompanied by a military escort of suitable
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:pomp, Caesar vows revenge for the disgraceful treatment of his sister and for Antony’s proclamation giving Rome’s eastern provinces to Cleopatra and her children (III,vi).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Octavius Caesar and Antony engage in battle, and Cleopatra insists on being present, much to the disapproval of Antony’s
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:commanders. Antony decides to fight Caesar at sea, which Cleopatra supports, but others advise against such a strategy.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:But Antony insists, and all blame Cleopatra’s bad influence for Antony’s poor decision (III,vii). Antony and Cleopatra go
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:to battle at sea, but the Egyptian fleet soon turns and flees, and Antony’s ships follow Cleopatra’s in retreat. Antony loses
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the battle in disgrace.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:5
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony delivers a passionate speech, lamenting his poor strategy and advising his followers to flee as well. He offers his
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:treasure to them as compensation. Cleopatra begs Antony’s forgiveness for her cowardliness. Softened by her heartfelt plea,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony forgives her (III,xi).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Through the messages of his ambassador, Antony requests that Caesar allow him to live in Egypt with Cleopatra. If not,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony asks that Ceasar grant him leave to carry on a private life in Athens. Cleopatra also surrenders to Caesar and asks
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:that the crown of the Ptolemies (Egypt) be reserved for her heirs. Caesar refuses Antony’s requests but agrees to
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra’s, provided that she exile Antony in disgrace or kill him (III,xii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Back at Cleopatra’s palace, Antony learns of Caesar’s answer and, against all odds, demands a hand-to-hand combat with
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Caesar. Having finally lost his faith in Antony’s power of reason, Enobarbus decides to leave Antony’s service. Caesar sends
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:his officer Thidias to win Cleopatra. But when Thidias is caught kissing Cleopatra’s hand, Antony has him whipped.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Humiliated, Thidias scurries back to Caesar. Antony accuses Cleopatra of being a faithless strumpet, but she swears her
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:loyalty and he, once more, forgives her. Antony declares a last night of revelry before the final battle, where he has promised to fight Caesar to the death (III,xiii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony prepares for battle and bids a tearful farewell to his loyal servants (IV,ii). While in battle camp he learns that the loyal
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Enobarbus has deserted him at last. He forgives Enobarbus and sends his belongings after him along with a number of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:additional gifts (IV, v). Enobarbus, learning of Antony’s forgiveness and generosity, is wracked with guilt over his desertion.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:He refuses to fight in Caesar’s army against Antony and vows to die in a ditch, considering it an appropriately foul end
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:to such a foul deed (IV,vi). As the watchmen carry him away, the dying Enobarbus begs for Antony’s forgiveness (IV,ix).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Pursued by Antony’s fierce forces, Caesar’s troops retreat (IV,viii). Antony returns to Alexandria and a proud Cleopatra (IV,viii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Then Antony learns that Caesar’s navy is preparing for a counterattack at sea, and he orders his fleet into battle (IV,x). Antony
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:leaves Alexandria to observe the battle, and then returns, enraged. He has been betrayed! The Egyptian fleet has surrendered
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:and has appeared to support Caesar’s fleet. Irreconcilable, he accuses Cleopatra of betrayal and vows to kill her (IV,xii).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Fearing for her life, Cleopatra locks herself high in her monument. She sends Mardian, a eunuch, to tell Antony that she
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:has killed herself and the last word on her lips had been “Antony” (IV,xiii). Mardian dutifully reports on Cleopatra’s “suicide.” Overcome by the loss, Antony pledges to join Cleopatra in death. He orders Eros to make one final act as his servant and kill him. Reluctantly, Eros draws his sword, but asks Antony to turn away as he does this hateful deed. At the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:last moment, Eros kills himself instead. Antony praises Eros’s valiant act and takes it as a lesson for himself. Antony
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:impales himself on his own sword but fails to strike a fatal wound. Guards swarm into the room and halt his further
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:attempts at suicide. Diomedes, Cleopatra’s servant, arrives to announce that Cleopatra is not dead after all. Mortally
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:wounded, Antony asks to be taken to Cleopatra’s side so that he may die in his lover’s arms (IV,xiv).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Antony is carried to Cleopatra’s monument and pleads for one last kiss. Fearing capture by Octavius, Cleopatra refuses to
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:leave the monument. Instead, she bids her ladies to lift Antony up to her. He dies in her arms. Overcome by the loss of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:her lover, Cleopatra vows to take her own life (IV,xv).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:At his camp, Caesar learns of Antony’s suicide. He mourns Antony’s death, claiming that such a death should shatter the very
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:world. An Egyptian servant arrives asking Caesar what will become of Cleopatra. Caesar assures the servant that he will treat
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra gently and with dignity. Fearing Cleopatra’s irrational behavior, Caesar sends his officer Proculeius to ensure
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:that Cleopatra is brought back to Rome alive, for her arrival there would provide evidence of Caesar’s great victory (V,i).
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Proculeius arrives at Cleopatra’s monument and informs her that Caesar has assured both her safety and her son’s continued
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:rule of Egypt. But she fears the servant is untrustworthy and attempts to kill herself with a dagger. Proculeius commands
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:his guards to stop her, but she vows that she will find another way to kill herself rather than become Caesar’s captive.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Dolabella, Caesar’s officer, reveals that Caesar instead intends to take her and her children to Rome. Fearful that she would
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:have to endure many indignities if she complied, Cleopatra resolves to commit suicide in the “high Roman fashion.”
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra prepares for death. She invites into her chambers a trusted countryman who arrives with a basket of figs in
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:which he has concealed several poisonous asps. As Cleopatra bids farewell to her ladies, Iras and Charmian, Iras suddenly falls dead at her feet. Worried that her attendant will meet Antony in death before she does, Cleopatra quickly clutches an asp to her breast. She applies another to her arm and soon dies from their bites. As one of Caesar’s guards enters,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Charmian announces that the escort was too slow to stop an act so fitting of a noble queen. Charmian applies the last asp
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:to herself and dies. Caesar, upon learning of Cleopatra’s valiant death, pays tribute to her courage and noble end. He
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:orders her burial next to Antony in honorable graves accompanied with great ceremony (V,ii).

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Before reading the play, students should explore the time period and historical significance of the play’s action. They should
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:become familiar with the famous tales of Julius Caesar, Marcus Antony, and Queen Cleopatra, which were well known to
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Elizabethans. Students should become acquainted with the topographical world in 44 b.c. and the effects of divided power
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:on war and land acquisitions. Finally, students should delve into the language of Shakespeare’s play, with its implied meanings and poetic language. An understanding of the effects of iambic pentameter and purposeful switches to prose to imply
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:character, class, subtext, and action is essential for higher levels of literary appreciation and understanding.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Following is a list of exercises and assignments that will support this manner of text and content exploration. Any of the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:exercises may be expanded or adapted as time and facilities allow.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The game consists of three rounds. To play each round:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Deal out one Strategy Card to each ruler. (Use the Strategy Card to influence your Declaration and strategy during the round.)
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Privately read your Strategy Card and decide how this will influence your Declaration. Leaders do not conspire before
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:they announce their Declarations, but if one ruler wishes to request the aid of another ruler in war before the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Declarations are made, a “Request for Allies” is offered.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Request Allies by passing small notes to certain rulers. The contents of the notes are not to be known until all three
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:rounds are complete. Once declarations are made there is no turning back. The rulers must make Declarations that
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:are based on the Strategy Cards, for the card’s strategies will all be exposed after all three rounds have been played.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:(This assures that students, as in life and in the play’s action, are not always sure whom to trust and exactly how their
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:actions are motivated.)
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Make your declaration of war on a specific ruler or territory, or plea for peace or abstinence, by making a Declaration
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Statement one at a time. (Examples of Declaration Statements given below.)
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:After all five Declarations are made, move the game pieces representing armies and rulers to declared locations of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:wars, or in retreat to your own land. (Armies placed in war will either win or lose soldiers. Those that stay at home
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:and are not attacked, lose nothing, but gain nothing.)
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:If you combine forces with another ruler and outnumber another army placed on the same territory, the outnumbered army gives up one half of his/her soldiers to the larger army and these soldiers are divided equally amongst the
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:winning rulers. If you do not combine forces and armies are equal, the round is a draw.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:The leader with the most game pieces after three rounds wins and holds whatever land his/her army has conquered over
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:other armies.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:SUGGESTIONS FOR STRATEGY CARDS:

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:II. THE ANCIENT WORLD
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Acquaint students with the geography of Antony’s and Cleopatra’s world by posting a map of the world depicting the division of land and ancient names of these lands as listed in the play.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Show students the territories governed by the five rulers in the play.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Use the map as a visual guide to the play’s action so that students can see territories lost and gained.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Use color-coded push-pins, flags, or post-it notes to represent where rulers are during each scene. Also keep track of
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:each ruler’s armies.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Have students point to where each scene takes place so they can follow the action.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Students can also create map images of the play’s action using a computer and a simple graphics program, like Power
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Point. They can highlight territories gained and lost during the play’s action and present these images to the class showing how the play’s world changes with each battle.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:III. STORYTELLING
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Shakespeare, one of the greatest storytellers of the English language, adapted most of his plays from popular, well-known
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:tales. As any good storyteller does, he took artistic license with these tales and made his own adaptations of the original.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:So, too, could the students.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Before reading the play, tell students the beginning of the story of Antony and Cleopatra and then have them finish
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the story, predicting how it will end.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Students can write their own stories or small groups can create group stories with each member adding to it.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Then they can simply tell their version to the class or explore an original method of presenting the story. As
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Shakespeare used the stage and drama, students could also use drama or comic strips, radio plays, spoof skits, readers’ theater, soap opera, poetry, rap, ballad, mime, dance, video, email exchanges, news announcement, etc. This can
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:be a lengthy and creative exercise where students invest in the possibilities and methods of storytelling.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Once all stories are presented, students can discuss and perhaps vote on the most likely ending to match Shakespeare’s version.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:IV. WHAT MAKES A TRAGEDY?
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Introduce students to Aristotle’s Poetics. Outline the contents of an effective tragedy interpreted from Aristotle’s Poetics,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:including:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:1.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Tragedy—a serious play typically dealing with the problems of a central character, or protagonist, leading to an unhappy
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:or disastrous ending brought on by fate and a tragic flaw in the main character
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:2.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Hubris—wanton insolence or arrogance resulting from excessive pride or from passion
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:3.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Foreshadowing—to indicate or suggest beforehand
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:4.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Climax—the highest point of interest or tension in a drama, and the turning point of the play’s action
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:5.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Catharsis—the purifying of the emotions or relieving of emotional tensions
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:6.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Denouement—the outcome, solution, unraveling or clarification of a plot in a drama
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Discuss Aristotle’s six constituent elements of a Tragedy, ranked in order of priority:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:1. Plot—the arrangement of dramatic incidents
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:2. Characters—the people represented in the play
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:3. Thought or Theme—the ideas explored
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:4. Language—the dialogue and poetry
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:5. Music—the choral odes (specific to Greek plays)
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:6. Spectacle—scenery and other visual elements
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:A Teacher’s Guide to the Signet Classic Edition of William Shakespeare’s Antony and Cleopatra
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:9
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Relate these elements to other contemporary real-life tragedies like politicians or leaders who are scandalized publicly for
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:having extra-marital affairs, committing crimes or for covering a lie. Students can also read Greek and Roman myths,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:other tragic plays by Shakespeare, and/or watch popular tragic movies, like Braveheart. As students read Antony and
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra they should identify places where these elements are exposed through the play’s action and discuss the characters’ flaws and the cause of each character’s downfall or success.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:V. UNDERSTANDING REAL VS. DRAMATIC ACTION
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Have students read books or watch documentaries that depict life in Rome, Egypt, and the ancient world. They can
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:explore transportation, styles of dress, methods of war as well as uniforms and arms. This provides students with clear
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:visual images of the characters and their lifestyles. Likewise, they will begin to understand how long it took to move armies
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:from place to place. Students can then understand how, within the play’s two-hour dramatic action, many years elapse.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:During the time of the play’s five acts, Antony and Cleopatra have born a number of children together, and many battles
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:have been won or lost.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Have students speculate how much time has passed during the play’s action and look to the text to support these speculations. For example, in Act III, scene vi, Caesar complains of Antony’s public display of his bastard children and his declarations to give more of the Triumvirate’s land to Cleopatra:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:CAESAR: I’th’marketplace, on a tribunal silvered,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Were publicly enthroned; at the feet sat
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Caesarion, whom they call my father’s son,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Since then hath made between them, Unto her
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:He gave the stablishment of Egypt, made her
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Absolute queen
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:VI. KEEPING TRACK OF THE CHARACTERS AND THEIR LOYALTIES
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Have students divide a piece of paper into four columns and place the rulers, Caesar, Antony, Cleopatra, and Pompey, at
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the top of each column. Underneath, list his/her loyal followers. Students can place this chart next to the script as they
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:read the play and keep track of the loyalties of the minor characters. As minor characters betray their leaders, retreat or
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:die, students can either cross out or move them to other columns, keeping track of power shifts.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:VII. KNOWING THE STORY AS THE ELIZABETHANS DID
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Most Elizabethans were familiar with the tale of Antony and Cleopatra before Shakespeare produced his drama about
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:them. Shakespeare’s source was most likely Plutarch and it is included as supplemental reading in the Signet Classic text.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Students can read Plutarch’s story before they read the play and later discuss how Shakespeare adapted Plutarch’s famous
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:tale to the stage. Assign portions of Plutarch’s tale to small groups to read and relate to the class either by oral reading or
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:storytelling.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:I. FORMING INDIVIDUAL INTERPRETATIONS OF SCENES
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Many scenes offer an opportunity for individual interpretations. For example: where Cleopatra’s integrity and honesty are
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:questionable, where an officer’s or servant’s loyalty sways, or where humor and sarcasm are used to expose subtext. Can
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:students form their own opinions of these interpretations? If so, how do they interpret them?
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Divide the characters’ parts amongst the students, reading the play orally. Discuss interpretations of scenes and character motivations.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Divide the class into small groups, assigning a scene to each group. Have them rehearse, practicing voice, inflection,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:and emotion. They can prepare an introduction to the scene, set the stage, and then read the scene aloud with their
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:practiced interpretations while the rest of the class attempts to summarize the scene in writing. The class can then
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:discuss perceived interpretations gained through these presentations.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Staging methods can also be explored by individuals or small groups. For example, in Act IV, scene xv, Cleopatra is
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:in her monument with her ladies. She asks them to help lift the dying Antony up to her so that she will not have to
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:leave the safety of her monument. Assign this same scene to a few different individuals or groups and compare interpretations and solutions to its staging challenge.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:II. EXPLORING THE SOUNDS OF THE PLAY
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Shakespeare’s plays were performed outdoors with minimal props. Elizabethan theater practitioners had to be quite creative using inexpensive devices to create magic and action on stage. This activity reinforces the live action and stage sounds
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:of drama, as well as introduces students to simplified staging devices as a means of bringing a play to life.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Assign small groups to specific scenes from the play. Provide each group with a cassette recorder. Have students practice reading
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:the scenes aloud, playing specific characters and providing sound effects. Students enjoy bringing objects to class that make
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:supportive sound effects, including crowd and battle noises, footsteps upon character’s entrances, swords being drawn,
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:snakes attacking, etc. Have students record the scenes as a mini radio play. Groups then play their scenes in sequence.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:III. INTERPRETING CONTENT THROUGH DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Pose discussion questions before reading each scene or act that require students to delve into the content as they read it.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:After reading the scene, hold class discussions concerning their varied answers to the questions.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Assign journal entries that explore the answers to these questions.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Split the class into small groups and have them discuss the answers to questions posed and report on their findings.
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:•
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Split the class into small groups and assign each group a different scene to explore. Give each group one or two discovery questions to guide their exploratory work on the scene. Then have each group read the scene aloud and discuss their interpretations.

Antony and Cleopatra.txt:by Shakespeare? The Romans were known to flood the Coliseum and stage dramatic battle scenes. How might they have
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:staged Antony and Caesar’s battle at sea? Have students identify scenes that occur outside the play’s action, such as
Antony and Cleopatra.txt:Cleopatra’s barge arriving to meet Antony for the first time. Alternately, have them suggest scenes that could have happened, but did not. For example, Cleopatra does not commit suicide but Caesar does indeed parade her down the streets

Caesar.txt:JULIUS CAESAR
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:INTRODUCTION TO WILLIAM
Caesar.txt:SHAKESPEARE
Caesar.txt:William Shakespeare, or the “Bard” as people fondly
Caesar.txt:call him, permeates almost all aspects of our society.
Caesar.txt:He can be found in our classrooms, on our televisions,
Caesar.txt:in our theatres, and in our cinemas. Speaking to us
Caesar.txt:through his plays, Shakespeare comments on his life
Caesar.txt:and culture, as well as our own. Actors still regularly
Caesar.txt:perform his plays on the modern stage and screen. The
Caesar.txt:1990s, for example, saw the release of cinematic versions of Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and many more of his works.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Anti-Stratfordians — modern scholars who
Caesar.txt:question the authorship of Shakespeare’s plays —
Caesar.txt:have used this lack of information to argue that
Caesar.txt:William Shakespeare either never existed or, if he did
Caesar.txt:exist, did not write any of the plays we attribute to
Caesar.txt:him. They believe that another historical figure, such
Caesar.txt:as Francis Bacon or Queen Elizabeth I, used the
Caesar.txt:name as a cover. Whether a man named William
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare ever actually existed is ultimately secondary to the recognition that the group of plays
Caesar.txt:bound together by that name does exist and continues to educate, enlighten, and entertain us.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In addition to the popularity of Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:plays as he wrote them, other writers have modernized his works to attract new audiences. For example,
Caesar.txt:West Side Story places Romeo and Juliet in New York
Caesar.txt:City, and A Thousand Acres sets King Lear in Iowa
Caesar.txt:corn country. Beyond adaptations and productions,
Caesar.txt:his life and works have captured our cultural imagination. The twentieth century witnessed the production of a play about two minor characters from
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s Hamlet in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Caesar.txt:are Dead and a fictional movie about Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:early life and poetic inspiration in Shakespeare in Love.
Caesar.txt:Despite his monumental presence in our culture,
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare remains enigmatic. He does not tell us
Caesar.txt:which plays he wrote alone, on which plays he collaborated with other playwrights, or which versions
Caesar.txt:of his plays to read and perform. Furthermore, with
Caesar.txt:only a handful of documents available about his life,
Caesar.txt:he does not tell us much about Shakespeare the person, forcing critics and scholars to look to historical
Caesar.txt:references to uncover the true-life great dramatist.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Family life
Caesar.txt:Though scholars are unsure of the exact date
Caesar.txt:of Shakespeare’s birth, records indicate that his
Caesar.txt:parents — Mary and John Shakespeare — baptized
Caesar.txt:him on April 26, 1564, in the small provincial town
Caesar.txt:of Stratford-upon-Avon — so named because it sat
Caesar.txt:on the banks of the Avon river. Because common
Caesar.txt:practice was to baptize infants a few days after they
Caesar.txt:were born, scholars generally recognize April 23,
Caesar.txt:1564, as Shakespeare’s birthday. Coincidentally, April
Caesar.txt:23 is the day of St. George, the patron saint of England, as well as the day upon which Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:would die 52 years later. William was the third of
Caesar.txt:Mary and John’s eight children and the first of four
Caesar.txt:sons. The house in which scholars believe Shakespeare to have been born stands on Henley Street
Caesar.txt:and, despite many modifications over the years, you
Caesar.txt:can still visit it today.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s father
Caesar.txt:Prior to Shakespeare’s birth, John Shakespeare lived
Caesar.txt:in Snitterfield, where he married Mary Arden, the
Caesar.txt:daughter of his landlord. After moving to Stratford
Caesar.txt:in 1552, he worked as a glover, a moneylender, and
Caesar.txt:a dealer in agricultural products such as wool and
Caesar.txt:grain. He also pursued public office and achieved a
Caesar.txt:variety of posts including bailiff, Stratford’s highest
Caesar.txt:elected position — equivalent to a small town’s
Caesar.txt:mayor. At the height of his career, sometime near
Caesar.txt:1576, he petitioned the Herald’s Office for a coat of
Caesar.txt:arms and thus the right to be a gentleman. But the
Caesar.txt:rise from the middle class to the gentry did not come
Caesar.txt:right away, and the costly petition expired without
Caesar.txt:being granted.
Caesar.txt:About this time, John Shakespeare mysteriously
Caesar.txt:fell into financial difficulty. He became involved in
Caesar.txt:serious litigation, was assessed heavy fines, and even
Caesar.txt:lost his seat on the town council. Some scholars
Caesar.txt:suggest that this decline could have resulted from
Caesar.txt:religious discrimination because the Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:family may have supported Catholicism, the practice of which was illegal in England. However, other

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:scholars point out that not all religious dissenters
Caesar.txt:(both Catholics and radical Puritans) lost their
Caesar.txt:posts due to their religion. Whatever the cause of
Caesar.txt:his decline, John did regain some prosperity toward
Caesar.txt:the end of his life. In 1596, the Herald’s Office
Caesar.txt:granted the Shakespeare family a coat of arms at the
Caesar.txt:petition of William, by now a successful playwright
Caesar.txt:in London. And John, prior to his death in 1601,
Caesar.txt:regained his seat on Stratford’s town council.
Caesar.txt:Childhood and education
Caesar.txt:Our understanding of William Shakespeare’s childhood in Stratford is primarily speculative because
Caesar.txt:children do not often appear in the legal records
Caesar.txt:from which many scholars attempt to reconstruct
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s life. Based on his father’s local prominence, scholars speculate that Shakespeare most
Caesar.txt:likely attended King’s New School, a school that usually employed Oxford graduates and was generally
Caesar.txt:well respected. Shakespeare would have started petty
Caesar.txt:school — the rough equivalent to modern preschool — at the age of four or five. He would have
Caesar.txt:learned to read on a hornbook, which was a sheet of
Caesar.txt:parchment or paper on which the alphabet and the
Caesar.txt:Lord’s Prayer were written. This sheet was framed in
Caesar.txt:wood and covered with a transparent piece of horn
Caesar.txt:for durability. After two years in petty school,
Caesar.txt:he would have transferred to grammar school,
Caesar.txt:where his school day would have probably lasted

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:While in grammar school, Shakespeare would
Caesar.txt:primarily have studied Latin, reciting and reading
Caesar.txt:the works of classical Roman authors such as Plautus, Ovid, Seneca, and Horace. Traces of these
Caesar.txt:authors’ works can be seen in his dramatic texts.
Caesar.txt:Toward his last years in grammar school, Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:would have acquired some basic skills in Greek as
Caesar.txt:well. Thus the remark made by Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s well-educated friend and contemporary playwright, that Shakespeare knew “small Latin and less
Caesar.txt:Greek” is accurate. Jonson is not saying that when
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare left grammar school he was only semiliterate; he merely indicates that Shakespeare did not
Caesar.txt:attend University, where he would have gained more
Caesar.txt:Latin and Greek instruction.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:For seven years after the twins’ baptism, the
Caesar.txt:records remain silent on Shakespeare. At some point,
Caesar.txt:he traveled to London and became involved with the
Caesar.txt:theatre, but he could have been anywhere between
Caesar.txt:21 and 28 years old when he did. Though some have
Caesar.txt:suggested that he may have served as an assistant to
Caesar.txt:a schoolmaster at a provincial school, it seems likely
Caesar.txt:that he went to London to become an actor, gradually becoming a playwright and gaining attention.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Wife and children
Caesar.txt:When Shakespeare became an adult, the historical
Caesar.txt:records documenting his existence began to increase.
Caesar.txt:In November 1582, at the age of 18, he married 26year-old Anne Hathaway from the nearby village of
Caesar.txt:Shottery. The disparity in their ages, coupled with
Caesar.txt:the fact that they baptized their first daughter,
Caesar.txt:Susanna, only six months later in May 1583, has
Caesar.txt:caused a great deal of modern speculation about the
Caesar.txt:nature of their relationship. However, sixteenth-century conceptions of marriage differed slightly from
Caesar.txt:our modern notions. Though all marriages needed
Caesar.txt:to be performed before a member of the clergy, many
Caesar.txt:of Shakespeare’s contemporaries believed that a couple could establish a relationship through a premarital contract by exchanging vows in front of
Caesar.txt:witnesses. This contract removed the social stigma
Caesar.txt:of pregnancy before marriage. (Shakespeare’s plays
Caesar.txt:contain instances of marriage prompted by pregnancy, and Measure for Measure includes this kind of
Caesar.txt:premarital contract.) Two years later, in February
Caesar.txt:1585, Shakespeare baptized his twins Hamnet and
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The plays: On stage and in print
Caesar.txt:The next mention of Shakespeare comes in 1592 by
Caesar.txt:a University wit named Robert Greene when Shakespeare apparently was already a rising actor and
Caesar.txt:playwright for the London stage. Greene, no longer
Caesar.txt:a successful playwright, tried to warn other University wits about Shakespeare. He wrote:
Caesar.txt:For there is an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers,
Caesar.txt:that with his “Tiger’s heart wrapped in a player’s
Caesar.txt:hide” supposes he is as well able to bombast out a
Caesar.txt:blank verse as the best of you, and, being an absolute
Caesar.txt:Johannes Factotum, is in his own conceit the only
Caesar.txt:Shake-scene in a country.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:This statement comes at a point in time when
Caesar.txt:men without a university education, like Shakespeare, were starting to compete as dramatists with
Caesar.txt:the University wits. As many critics have pointed out,
Caesar.txt:Greene’s statement recalls a line from 3 Henry VI,
Caesar.txt:which reads, “O tiger’s heart wrapped in a woman’s
Caesar.txt:hide!” (I.4.137). Greene’s remark does not indicate
Caesar.txt:that Shakespeare was generally disliked. On the contrary, another University wit, Thomas Nashe, wrote
Caesar.txt:of the great theatrical success of Henry VI, and Henry
Caesar.txt:Chettle, Greene’s publisher, later printed a flattering
Caesar.txt:apology to Shakespeare. What Greene’s statement
Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:does show us is that Shakespeare’s reputation for poetry
Caesar.txt:had reached enough of a
Caesar.txt:prominence to provoke the
Caesar.txt:envy of a failing competitor.
Caesar.txt:In the following year,
Caesar.txt:1593, the government
Caesar.txt:closed London’s theatres due
Caesar.txt:to an outbreak of the
Caesar.txt:bubonic plague. Publication
Caesar.txt:history suggests that during
Caesar.txt:this closure, Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:may have written his two
Caesar.txt:narrative poems, Venus and
Caesar.txt:Adonis, published in 1593,
Caesar.txt:and The Rape of Lucrece,
Caesar.txt:published in 1594. These
Caesar.txt:are the only two works that A ground plan of London after the fire of 1666, drawn by Marcus Willemsz Doornik.

Caesar.txt:Recent scholars suggest that Shakespeare’s great
Caesar.txt:joined the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, an acting comtragedy, Julius Caesar, may have been the first of

Caesar.txt:Introduction to William Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The modern day equivalent of a quarto would be a
Caesar.txt:paperback. In contrast, the first collected works of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare were in folio format, which means that
Caesar.txt:the printer folded each sheet only once. Scholars call
Caesar.txt:the collected edition of Shakespeare’s works the First
Caesar.txt:Folio. A folio was a larger and more prestigious book
Caesar.txt:than a quarto, and printers generally reserved the format for works such as the Bible.
Caesar.txt:No evidence exists that Shakespeare participated
Caesar.txt:in the publication of any of his plays. Members of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s acting company printed the First Folio
Caesar.txt:seven years after Shakespeare’s death. Generally, playwrights wrote their works to be performed on stage,
Caesar.txt:and publishing them was a novel innovation at the
Caesar.txt:time. Shakespeare probably would not have thought
Caesar.txt:of them as books in the way we do. In fact, as a principal investor in the acting company (which purchased the play as well as the exclusive right to
Caesar.txt:perform it), he may not have even thought of them
Caesar.txt:as his own. He would probably have thought of his
Caesar.txt:plays as belonging to the company.
Caesar.txt:For this reason, scholars have generally characterized most quartos printed before the Folio as
Caesar.txt:“bad” by arguing that printers pirated the plays and
Caesar.txt:published them illegally. How would a printer have
Caesar.txt:received a pirated copy of a play? The theories range
Caesar.txt:from someone stealing a copy to an actor (or actors)
Caesar.txt:selling the play by relating it from memory to a
Caesar.txt:printer. Many times, major differences exist between
Caesar.txt:a quarto version of the play and a folio version, causing uncertainty about which is Shakespeare’s true creation. Hamlet, for example, is almost twice as long
Caesar.txt:in the Folio as in quarto versions. Recently, scholars
Caesar.txt:have come to realize the value of the different versions. The Norton Shakespeare, for example, includes
Caesar.txt:all three versions of King Lear — the quarto, the
Caesar.txt:folio, and the conflated version (the combination of
Caesar.txt:the quarto and folio).
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:5
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Prolific productions
Caesar.txt:The first decade of the 1600s witnessed the publication of additional quartos as well as the production
Caesar.txt:of most of Shakespeare’s great tragedies, with Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar appearing in 1599 and Hamlet in 1600–1601.
Caesar.txt:After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the
Caesar.txt:Lord Chamberlain’s Men became the King’s Men
Caesar.txt:under James I, Elizabeth’s successor. Around the time
Caesar.txt:of this transition in the English monarchy, the
Caesar.txt:famous tragedy Othello (1603–1604) was most likely
Caesar.txt:written and performed, followed closely by King Lear
Caesar.txt:(1605–1606), Antony and Cleopatra (1606), and
Caesar.txt:Macbeth (1606) in the next two years.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s name also appears as a major
Caesar.txt:investor in the 1609 acquisition of an indoor theatre
Caesar.txt:known as the Blackfriars. This last period of Shakespeare’s career, which includes plays that considered
Caesar.txt:the acting conditions both at the Blackfriars and the
Caesar.txt:open-air Globe theatre, consists primarily of
Caesar.txt:romances or tragicomedies such as The Winter’s Tale
Caesar.txt:and The Tempest. On June 29, 1613, during a performance of All is True, or Henry VIII, the thatching
Caesar.txt:on top of The Globe caught fire and the playhouse
Caesar.txt:burned to the ground. After this incident, the King’s
Caesar.txt:Men moved solely into the indoor Blackfriars
Caesar.txt:Theatre.
Caesar.txt:Final days
Caesar.txt:During the last years of his career, Shakespeare collaborated on a couple of plays with contemporary
Caesar.txt:dramatist John Fletcher, even possibly coming out
Caesar.txt:of retirement — which scholars believe began sometime in 1613 — to work on The Two Noble Kinsmen
Caesar.txt:(1613–1614). Three years later, Shakespeare died on
Caesar.txt:April 23, 1616. Though the exact cause of death
Caesar.txt:remains unknown, a vicar from Stratford in the midseventeenth-century wrote in his diary that Shakespeare, perhaps celebrating the marriage of his
Caesar.txt:daughter, Judith, contracted a fever during a night

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:of revelry with fellow literary figures Ben Jonson and
Caesar.txt:Michael Drayton. Regardless, Shakespeare may have
Caesar.txt:felt his death was imminent in March of that year
Caesar.txt:because he altered his will. Interestingly, his will mentions no book or theatrical manuscripts, perhaps
Caesar.txt:indicating the lack of value that he put on printed
Caesar.txt:versions of his dramatic works and their status as
Caesar.txt:company property.
Caesar.txt:Seven years after Shakespeare’s death, John
Caesar.txt:Heminge and Henry Condell, fellow members of the
Caesar.txt:King’s Men, published his collected works. In their
Caesar.txt:preface, they claim that they are publishing the true
Caesar.txt:versions of Shakespeare’s plays partially as a response
Caesar.txt:to the previous quarto printings of 18 of his plays,
Caesar.txt:most of these with multiple printings. This Folio
Caesar.txt:contains 36 plays to which scholars generally add
Caesar.txt:Pericles and The Two Noble Kinsmen. This volume of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s plays began the process of constructing Shakespeare not only as England’s national poet
Caesar.txt:but also as a monumental figure whose plays would
Caesar.txt:continue to captivate imaginations at the end of the
Caesar.txt:millennium with no signs of stopping. Ben Jonson’s

Caesar.txt:A note on Shakespeare’s language
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:7
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Readers encountering Shakespeare for the first time
Caesar.txt:usually find Early Modern English difficult to understand. Yet, rather than serving as a barrier to Shakespeare, the richness of this language should form part
Caesar.txt:of our appreciation of the Bard.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare often employs these puns as a way of
Caesar.txt:illustrating the distance between what is on the surface — apparent meanings — and what meanings lie
Caesar.txt:underneath. Though recognizing these puns may be
Caesar.txt:difficult at first, the notes in the far right column
Caesar.txt:point many of them out to you.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:One of the first things readers usually notice
Caesar.txt:about the language is the use of pronouns. Like the
Caesar.txt:King James Version of the Bible, Shakespeare’s pronouns are slightly different from our own and can
Caesar.txt:cause confusion. Words like “thou” (you), “thee” and
Caesar.txt:“ye” (objective cases of you), and “thy” and “thine”
Caesar.txt:(your/yours) appear throughout Shakespeare’s plays.
Caesar.txt:You may need a little time to get used to these
Caesar.txt:changes. You can find the definitions for other words
Caesar.txt:that commonly cause confusion in the glossary column on the right side of each page in this edition.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:If you are encountering Shakespeare’s plays for
Caesar.txt:the first time, the following reading tips may help
Caesar.txt:ease you into the plays. Shakespeare’s lines were
Caesar.txt:meant to be spoken; therefore, reading them aloud
Caesar.txt:or speaking them should help with comprehension.
Caesar.txt:Also, though most of the lines are poetic, do not forget to read complete sentences — move from period
Caesar.txt:to period as well as from line to line. Although
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s language can be difficult at first, the
Caesar.txt:rewards of immersing yourself in the richness and
Caesar.txt:fluidity of the lines are immeasurable.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Iambic pentameter
Caesar.txt:Though Shakespeare sometimes wrote in prose, he
Caesar.txt:wrote most of his plays in poetry, specifically blank
Caesar.txt:verse. Blank verse consists of lines in unrhymed
Caesar.txt:iambic pentameter. Iambic refers to the stress patterns
Caesar.txt:of the line. An iamb is an element of sound that consists of two beats — the first unstressed (da) and the
Caesar.txt:second stressed (DA). A good example of an iambic
Caesar.txt:line is Hamlet’s famous line “To be or not to be,” in
Caesar.txt:which you do not stress “To,” “or,” and “to,” but you
Caesar.txt:do stress “be,” “not,” and “be.” Pentameter refers to
Caesar.txt:the meter or number of stressed syllables in a line.
Caesar.txt:Pentameter has five stressed syllables. Thus, Romeo’s
Caesar.txt:line “But soft, what light through yonder window
Caesar.txt:breaks?” (II.2.2) is a good example of an iambic pentameter line.
Caesar.txt:Wordplay
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s language is also verbally rich as he,
Caesar.txt:along with many dramatists of his period, had a
Caesar.txt:fondness for wordplay. This wordplay often takes the
Caesar.txt:forms of double meanings, called puns, where a word
Caesar.txt:can mean more than one thing in a given context.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:INTRODUCTION TO EARLY
Caesar.txt:MODERN ENGLAND
Caesar.txt:William Shakespeare (1564–1616) lived during a
Caesar.txt:period in England’s history that people have generally referred to as the English Renaissance. The term
Caesar.txt:renaissance, meaning rebirth, was applied to this
Caesar.txt:period of English history as a way of celebrating what
Caesar.txt:was perceived as the rapid development of art, literature, science, and politics: in many ways, the rebirth
Caesar.txt:of classical Rome.
Caesar.txt:Recently, scholars have challenged the name
Caesar.txt:“English Renaissance” on two grounds. First, some
Caesar.txt:scholars argue that the term should not be used
Caesar.txt:because women did not share in the advancements
Caesar.txt:of English culture during this time period; their legal
Caesar.txt:status was still below that of men. Second, other
Caesar.txt:scholars have challenged the basic notion that this
Caesar.txt:period saw a sudden explosion of culture. A rebirth
Caesar.txt:of civilization suggests that the previous period of
Caesar.txt:time was not civilized. This second group of scholars sees a much more gradual transition between the
Caesar.txt:Middle Ages and Shakespeare’s time.
Caesar.txt:Some people use the terms Elizabethan and
Caesar.txt:Jacobean when referring to periods of the sixteenth
Caesar.txt:and seventeenth centuries. These terms correspond
Caesar.txt:to the reigns of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and James
Caesar.txt:I (1603–1625). The problem with these terms is that
Caesar.txt:they do not cover large spans of time; for example,
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s life and career spans both monarchies.
Caesar.txt:Scholars are now beginning to replace Renaissance with the term Early Modern when referring to
Caesar.txt:this time period, but people still use both terms
Caesar.txt:interchangeably. The term Early Modern recognizes
Caesar.txt:that this period established many of the foundations
Caesar.txt:of our modern culture. Though critics still disagree
Caesar.txt:about the exact dates of the period, in general, the
Caesar.txt:dates range from 1450 to 1750. Thus, Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:life clearly falls within the Early Modern period.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s plays live on in our culture, but we
Caesar.txt:must remember that Shakespeare’s culture differed
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:greatly from our own. Though his understanding of
Caesar.txt:human nature and relationships seems to apply to
Caesar.txt:our modern lives, we must try to understand the
Caesar.txt:world he lived in so we can better understand his
Caesar.txt:plays. This introduction helps you do just that. It
Caesar.txt:examines the intellectual, religious, political, and
Caesar.txt:social contexts of Shakespeare’s work before turning
Caesar.txt:to the importance of the theatre and the printing
Caesar.txt:press.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Intellectual context
Caesar.txt:In general, people in Early Modern England looked
Caesar.txt:at the universe, the human body, and science very
Caesar.txt:differently from the way we do. But while we do not
Caesar.txt:share their same beliefs, we must not think of people during Shakespeare’s time as lacking in intelligence or education. Discoveries made during the
Caesar.txt:Early Modern period concerning the universe and
Caesar.txt:the human body provide the basis of modern science.
Caesar.txt:Cosmology
Caesar.txt:One subject we view very differently than Early
Caesar.txt:Modern thinkers is cosmology. Shakespeare’s contemporaries believed in the astronomy of Ptolemy,
Caesar.txt:an intellectual from Alexandria in the second century A.D. Ptolemy thought that the earth stood at
Caesar.txt:the center of the universe, surrounded by nine concentric rings. The celestial bodies circled the earth in
Caesar.txt:the following order: the moon, Mercury, Venus, the
Caesar.txt:sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the stars. The entire
Caesar.txt:system was controlled by the primum mobile, or
Caesar.txt:Prime Mover, which initiated and maintained the
Caesar.txt:movement of the celestial bodies. No one had yet
Caesar.txt:discovered the last three planets in our solar system,
Caesar.txt:Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.
Caesar.txt:In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published his theory of a sun-based solar system, in which the sun
Caesar.txt:stood at the center and the planets revolved around
Caesar.txt:it. Though this theory appeared prior to
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Early Modern England
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s birth, people didn’t really start to
Caesar.txt:change their minds until 1610, when Galileo used
Caesar.txt:his telescope to confirm Copernicus’ theory. David
Caesar.txt:Bevington asserts in the general introduction to his
Caesar.txt:edition of Shakespeare’s works that during most of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s writing career, the cosmology of the
Caesar.txt:universe was in question, and this sense of uncertainty influences some of his plays.
Caesar.txt:Universal hierarchy
Caesar.txt:Closely related to Ptolemy’s hierarchical view of the
Caesar.txt:universe is a hierarchical conception of the Earth
Caesar.txt:(sometimes referred to as the Chain of Being). During the Early Modern period, many people believed
Caesar.txt:that all of creation was organized hierarchically. God
Caesar.txt:existed at the top, followed by the angels, men,
Caesar.txt:women, animals, plants, and rocks. (Because all
Caesar.txt:women were thought to exist below all men on the
Caesar.txt:chain, we can easily imagine the confusion that Elizabeth I caused when she became queen of England.
Caesar.txt:She was literally “out of order,” an expression that still
Caesar.txt:exists in our society.) Though the concept of this hierarchy is a useful one when beginning to study Shakespeare, keep in mind that distinctions in this
Caesar.txt:hierarchical view were not always clear and that we
Caesar.txt:should not reduce all Early Modern thinking to a
Caesar.txt:simple chain.
Caesar.txt:Elements and humors
Caesar.txt:The belief in a hierarchical scheme of existence created a comforting sense of order and balance that
Caesar.txt:carried over into science as well. Shakespeare’s contemporaries generally accepted that four different
Caesar.txt:elements composed everything in the universe:
Caesar.txt:earth, air, water, and fire. People associated these
Caesar.txt:four elements with four qualities of being. These
Caesar.txt:qualities — hot, cold, moist, and dry — appeared
Caesar.txt:in different combinations in the elements. For
Caesar.txt:example, air was hot and moist; water was cold and
Caesar.txt:moist; earth was cold and dry; and fire was hot
Caesar.txt:and dry.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:9
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In addition, people believed that the human
Caesar.txt:body contained all four elements in the form
Caesar.txt:of humors — blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black
Caesar.txt:bile — each of which corresponded to an element.
Caesar.txt:Blood corresponded to air (hot and moist), phlegm
Caesar.txt:to water (cold and moist), yellow bile to fire (hot and
Caesar.txt:dry), and black bile to earth (cold and dry). When
Caesar.txt:someone was sick, physicians generally believed that
Caesar.txt:the patient’s humors were not in the proper balance.
Caesar.txt:For example, if someone were diagnosed with an
Caesar.txt:abundance of blood, the physician would bleed the
Caesar.txt:patient (using leeches or cutting the skin) in order
Caesar.txt:to restore the balance.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s contemporaries also believed that
Caesar.txt:the humors determined personality and temperament. If a person’s dominant humor was blood, he
Caesar.txt:was considered lighthearted. If dominated by yellow
Caesar.txt:bile (or choler), that person was irritable. The dominance of phlegm led a person to be dull and kind.
Caesar.txt:And if black bile prevailed, he was melancholy or sad.
Caesar.txt:Thus, people of Early Modern England often used
Caesar.txt:the humors to explain behavior and emotional outbursts. Throughout Shakespeare’s plays, he uses the
Caesar.txt:concept of the humors to define and explain various
Caesar.txt:characters. In the play Julius Caesar, the humors are
Caesar.txt:referred to on several occasions. For example, in Act
Caesar.txt:IV, Scene 3, the famous “quarrel scene,” Brutus
Caesar.txt:accuses a testy Cassius of having a “rash choler.”
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Religious context
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare lived in an England full of religious
Caesar.txt:uncertainty and dispute. From the Protestant Reformation to the translation of the Bible into English,
Caesar.txt:the Early Modern era is punctuated with events that
Caesar.txt:have greatly influenced modern religious beliefs.
Caesar.txt:The Reformation
Caesar.txt:Until the Protestant Reformation, the only Christian church was the Catholic, or “universal,” church.

Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Beginning in Europe in the early sixteenth century,
Caesar.txt:religious thinkers such as Martin Luther and John
Caesar.txt:Calvin, who claimed that the Roman Catholic
Caesar.txt:Church had become corrupt and was no longer following the word of God, began what has become
Caesar.txt:known as the Protestant Reformation. The Protestants (“protestors”) believed in salvation by faith
Caesar.txt:rather than works. They also believed in the primacy
Caesar.txt:of the Bible and advocated giving all people access
Caesar.txt:to reading the Bible.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Henry’s petitions for a divorce, forcing him to
Caesar.txt:divorce Catherine without the Church’s approval,
Caesar.txt:which he did in 1533.
Caesar.txt:The Act of Supremacy
Caesar.txt:The following year, the Pope excommunicated
Caesar.txt:Henry VIII while Parliament confirmed his divorce
Caesar.txt:and the legitimacy of his new marriage through the
Caesar.txt:Act of Succession. Later in 1534, Parliament passed
Caesar.txt:the Act of Supremacy, naming Henry the “Supreme
Caesar.txt:Head of the Church in England.” Henry continued
Caesar.txt:to persecute both radical Protestant reformers and
Caesar.txt:Catholics who remained loyal to Rome.
Caesar.txt:Henry VIII’s death in 1547 brought Edward VI,
Caesar.txt:his 10-year-old son by Jane Seymour (the king’s third
Caesar.txt:wife), to the throne. This succession gave Protestant
Caesar.txt:reformers the chance to solidify their break with the
Caesar.txt:Catholic Church. During Edward’s reign, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer established the foundation
Caesar.txt:for the Anglican Church through his 42 articles of
Caesar.txt:religion. He also wrote the first Book of Common
Caesar.txt:Prayer, adopted in 1549, which was the official text
Caesar.txt:for worship services in England.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Many English people initially resisted Protestant
Caesar.txt:ideas. However, the Reformation in England began
Caesar.txt:in 1527 during the reign of Henry VIII, prior to
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s birth. In that year, Henry VIII decided
Caesar.txt:to divorce his wife, Catherine of Aragon, for her failure to produce a male heir. (Only one of their children, Mary, survived past infancy.) Rome denied
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Bloody Mary
Caesar.txt:Catholics continued to be persecuted until 1553,
Caesar.txt:when the sickly Edward VI died and was succeeded
Caesar.txt:by Mary, his half-sister and the Catholic daughter of
Caesar.txt:Catherine of Aragon. The reign of Mary witnessed
Caesar.txt:the reversal of religion in England through the
Caesar.txt:restoration of Catholic authority and obedience to
Caesar.txt:Rome. Protestants were executed in large numbers,
Caesar.txt:which earned the monarch the nickname “Bloody
Caesar.txt:Mary.” Many Protestants fled to Europe to escape
Caesar.txt:persecution.
Caesar.txt:Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne
Caesar.txt:Boleyn, outwardly complied with the mandated
Caesar.txt:Catholicism during her half-sister Mary’s reign, but
Caesar.txt:she restored Protestantism when she took the throne
Caesar.txt:in 1558 after Mary’s death. Thus, in the space of a
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Early Modern England
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:single decade, England’s throne passed from Protestant to Catholic to Protestant, with each change carrying serious and deadly consequences.
Caesar.txt:Though Elizabeth reigned in relative peace from
Caesar.txt:1558 until her death in 1603, religion was still a serious concern for her subjects. During Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:life, a great deal of religious dissent existed in England. Many Catholics, who remained loyal to Rome
Caesar.txt:and their church, were persecuted for their beliefs. At
Caesar.txt:the other end of the spectrum, the Puritans were persecuted for their belief that the Reformation was not
Caesar.txt:complete. (The English pejoratively applied the term
Caesar.txt:Puritan to religious groups that wanted to continue
Caesar.txt:purifying the English church by such measures as
Caesar.txt:removing the episcopacy, or the structure of bishops.)
Caesar.txt:The Great Bible
Caesar.txt:One thing agreed upon by both the Anglicans
Caesar.txt:and Puritans was the importance of a Bible written
Caesar.txt:in English. Translated by William Tyndale in 1525,
Caesar.txt:the first authorized Bible in English, published in
Caesar.txt:1539, was known as the Great Bible. This Bible was
Caesar.txt:later revised during Elizabeth’s reign into what was
Caesar.txt:known as the Bishop’s Bible. As Stephen Greenblatt
Caesar.txt:points out in his introduction to the Norton Shakespeare, Shakespeare would probably have been familiar with both the Bishop’s Bible, heard aloud in Mass,
Caesar.txt:and the Geneva Bible, which was written by English
Caesar.txt:exiles in Geneva. The last authorized Bible produced
Caesar.txt:during Shakespeare’s lifetime came within the last
Caesar.txt:decade of his life when James I’s commissioned edition, known as the King James Bible, appeared in
Caesar.txt:1611.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:11
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Elizabeth I
Caesar.txt:Despite being a Protestant, Elizabeth I tried to take
Caesar.txt:a middle road on the religious question. She allowed
Caesar.txt:Catholics to practice their religion in private as long
Caesar.txt:as they outwardly appeared Anglican and remained
Caesar.txt:loyal to the throne.
Caesar.txt:Elizabeth’s monarchy was one of absolute
Caesar.txt:supremacy. Believing in the divine right of kings, she
Caesar.txt:styled herself as being appointed by God to rule England. To oppose the Queen’s will was the equivalent
Caesar.txt:of opposing God’s will. Known as passive obedience,
Caesar.txt:this doctrine did not allow any opposition even to a
Caesar.txt:tyrannical monarch because God had appointed the
Caesar.txt:king or queen for reasons unknown to His subjects
Caesar.txt:on earth. However, as Bevington notes, Elizabeth’s
Caesar.txt:power was not as absolute as her rhetoric suggested.
Caesar.txt:Parliament, already well established in England,
Caesar.txt:reserved some power, such as the authority to levy
Caesar.txt:taxes, for itself.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Political context
Caesar.txt:Politics and religion were closely related in Shakespeare’s England. Both of the monarchs under whom
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare lived had to deal with religious and
Caesar.txt:political dissenters.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Elizabeth I lived in a society that restricted
Caesar.txt:women from possessing any political or personal
Caesar.txt:autonomy and power. As queen, Elizabeth violated
Caesar.txt:and called into question many of the prejudices and
Caesar.txt:practices against women. In a way, her society forced
Caesar.txt:her to “overcome” her sex in order to rule effectively.
Caesar.txt:However, her position did nothing to increase the
Caesar.txt:status of women in England.
Caesar.txt:One of the rhetorical strategies that Elizabeth
Caesar.txt:adopted in order to rule effectively was to separate
Caesar.txt:her position as monarch of England from her natural body — to separate her body politic from her body
Caesar.txt:natural. In addition, throughout her reign, Elizabeth
Caesar.txt:brilliantly negotiated between domestic and foreign
Caesar.txt:factions — some of whom were anxious about a
Caesar.txt:female monarch and wanted her to marry — appeasing both sides without ever committing to one.
Caesar.txt:She remained unmarried throughout her 45-year
Caesar.txt:reign, partially by styling herself as the Virgin Queen
Caesar.txt:whose purity represented England herself. Her refusal
Caesar.txt:to marry and her habit of hinting and promising
Caesar.txt:marriage with suitors both foreign and domestic
Caesar.txt:helped Elizabeth maintain internal and external
Caesar.txt:peace. Not marrying allowed her to retain her independence, but it left the succession of the English
Caesar.txt:throne in question. In 1603, on her deathbed, she
Caesar.txt:named James VI, King of Scotland and son of her
Caesar.txt:cousin Mary, as her successor.
Caesar.txt:James I
Caesar.txt:When he assumed the English crown, James VI of
Caesar.txt:Scotland became James I of England. (Some historians refer to him as James VI and I.) Like Elizabeth,
Caesar.txt:James was a strong believer in the divine right of
Caesar.txt:kings and their absolute authority.
Caesar.txt:Upon his arrival in London to claim the English
Caesar.txt:throne, James made his plans to unite Scotland and
Caesar.txt:England clear. However, a long-standing history of
Caesar.txt:enmity existed between the two countries. Partially
Caesar.txt:as a result of this history and the influx of Scottish
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:courtiers into English society, anti-Scottish prejudice
Caesar.txt:abounded in England. When James asked Parliament
Caesar.txt:for the title of “King of Great Britain,” he was
Caesar.txt:denied.
Caesar.txt:As scholars such as Bevington have pointed out,
Caesar.txt:James was less successful than Elizabeth was in negotiating between the different religious and political
Caesar.txt:factions in England. Although he was a Protestant,
Caesar.txt:he began to have problems with the Puritan sect of
Caesar.txt:the House of Commons, which ultimately led to a
Caesar.txt:rift between the court (which also started to have
Caesar.txt:Catholic sympathies) and the Parliament. This rift
Caesar.txt:between the monarchy and Parliament eventually
Caesar.txt:escalated into the civil war that would erupt during
Caesar.txt:the reign of James’s son, Charles I.
Caesar.txt:In spite of its difficulties with Parliament, James’
Caesar.txt:court was a site of wealth, luxury, and extravagance.
Caesar.txt:James I commissioned elaborate feasts, masques, and
Caesar.txt:pageants, and in doing so he more than doubled the
Caesar.txt:royal debt. Stephen Greenblatt suggests that Shakespeare’s The Tempest may reflect this extravagance
Caesar.txt:through Prospero’s magnificent banquet and accompanying masque. Reigning from 1603 to 1625,
Caesar.txt:James I remained the King of England throughout
Caesar.txt:the last years of Shakespeare’s life.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Social context
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s England divided itself roughly into two
Caesar.txt:social classes: the aristocrats (or nobility) and everyone else. The primary distinctions between these two
Caesar.txt:classes were ancestry, wealth, and power. Simply put,
Caesar.txt:the aristocrats were the only ones who possessed all
Caesar.txt:three.
Caesar.txt:Aristocrats were born with their wealth, but the
Caesar.txt:growth of trade and the development of skilled professions began to provide wealth for those not born
Caesar.txt:with it. Although the notion of a middle class did
Caesar.txt:not begin to develop until after Shakespeare’s death,
Caesar.txt:the possibility of some social mobility did exist in
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Early Modern England
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:13
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Early Modern England. Shakespeare himself used the
Caesar.txt:wealth gained from the theatre to move into the
Caesar.txt:lower ranks of the aristocracy by securing a coat of
Caesar.txt:arms for his family.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Furthermore, women did not generally receive
Caesar.txt:an education and could not enter certain professions,
Caesar.txt:including acting. Instead, society relegated women
Caesar.txt:to the domestic sphere of the home.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare was not unique in this movement,
Caesar.txt:but not all people received the opportunity to
Caesar.txt:increase their social status. Members of the aristocracy feared this social movement and, as a result, promoted harsh laws of apprenticeship and fashion,
Caesar.txt:restricting certain styles of dress and material. These
Caesar.txt:laws dictated that only the aristocracy could wear certain articles of clothing, colors, and materials.
Caesar.txt:Though enforcement was a difficult task, the Early
Caesar.txt:Modern aristocracy considered dressing above one’s
Caesar.txt:station a moral and ethical violation.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Although there are only two women in Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar, Brutus’ wife, Portia, gives the reader an interesting look at Roman women through Elizabethan
Caesar.txt:eyes. In Act II, Scene 1, Portia is concerned about
Caesar.txt:her husband’s recent erratic behavior. Instead of
Caesar.txt:remaining the silent, complacent wife, Portia confronts her husband, asking Brutus to treat her as a
Caesar.txt:respected equal by revealing his secrets to her. She
Caesar.txt:reminds him that she is an honorable and constant
Caesar.txt:woman, strong enough to bear anything her husband
Caesar.txt:may reveal to her. Brutus eventually tells Portia his
Caesar.txt:plans, but by Act II, Scene 4, under the burdens of
Caesar.txt:those secrets, Portia laments, “how weak a thing /
Caesar.txt:The heart of woman is.” Frantic that she will betray
Caesar.txt:her husband, Portia complains that she has “a man’s
Caesar.txt:mind, but a woman’s might. / How hard it is for
Caesar.txt:women to keep counsel.”
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The status of women
Caesar.txt:The legal status of women did not allow them much
Caesar.txt:public or private autonomy. English society functioned on a system of patriarchy and hierarchy (see
Caesar.txt:“Universal hierarchy” earlier in this introduction),
Caesar.txt:which means that men controlled society beginning
Caesar.txt:with the individual family. In fact, the family
Caesar.txt:metaphorically corresponded to the state. For example, the husband was the king of his family. His
Caesar.txt:authority to control his family was absolute and
Caesar.txt:based on divine right, similar to that of the country’s
Caesar.txt:king. People also saw the family itself differently than
Caesar.txt:today, considering apprentices and servants part of
Caesar.txt:the whole family.
Caesar.txt:The practice of primogeniture — a system of
Caesar.txt:inheritance that passed all of a family’s wealth
Caesar.txt:through the first male child — accompanied this system of patriarchy. Thus women did not generally
Caesar.txt:inherit their family’s wealth and titles. In the absence
Caesar.txt:of a male heir, some women, such as Queen Elizabeth, did. But after women married, they lost almost
Caesar.txt:all of their already limited legal rights, such as the
Caesar.txt:right to inherit, to own property, and to sign contracts. In all likelihood, Elizabeth I would have lost
Caesar.txt:much of her power and authority if she married.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Daily life
Caesar.txt:Daily life in Early Modern England began before
Caesar.txt:sun-up — exactly how early depended on one’s station in life. A servant’s responsibilities usually
Caesar.txt:included preparing the house for the day. Families
Caesar.txt:usually possessed limited living space, and even
Caesar.txt:among wealthy families multiple family members
Caesar.txt:tended to share a small number of rooms, suggesting that privacy may not have been important or
Caesar.txt:practical.
Caesar.txt:Working through the morning, Elizabethans usually had lunch about noon. This midday meal was the
Caesar.txt:primary meal of the day, much like dinner is for modern families. The workday usually ended around sundown or 5:00 p.m., depending on the season. Before
Caesar.txt:an early bedtime, Elizabethans usually ate a light
Caesar.txt:repast and then settled in for a couple of hours of
Caesar.txt:reading (if the family members were literate and could
Caesar.txt:bear the high cost of books) or socializing.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Mortality rates
Caesar.txt:Mortality rates in Early Modern England were high
Caesar.txt:compared to our standards, especially among infants.
Caesar.txt:Infection and disease ran rampant because physicians
Caesar.txt:did not realize the need for antiseptics and sterile
Caesar.txt:equipment. As a result, communicable diseases often
Caesar.txt:spread very rapidly in cities, particularly London.
Caesar.txt:In addition, the bubonic plague frequently ravaged England, with two major outbreaks — from
Caesar.txt:1592–1594 and in 1603 — occurring during Shakespeare’s lifetime. People did not understand the
Caesar.txt:plague and generally perceived it as God’s punishment. (We now know that the plague was spread by
Caesar.txt:fleas and could not be spread directly from human
Caesar.txt:to human.) Without a cure or an understanding of
Caesar.txt:what transmitted the disease, physicians could do
Caesar.txt:nothing to stop the thousands of deaths that resulted
Caesar.txt:from each outbreak. These outbreaks had a direct
Caesar.txt:effect on Shakespeare’s career, because the government often closed the theatres in an effort to impede
Caesar.txt:the spread of the disease.
Caesar.txt:London life
Caesar.txt:In the sixteenth century, London, though small compared to modern cities, was the largest city of
Caesar.txt:Europe, with a population of about 200,000 inhabitants in the city and surrounding suburbs. London
Caesar.txt:was a crowded city without a sewer system, which
Caesar.txt:facilitated epidemics such as the plague. In addition,
Caesar.txt:crime rates were high in the city due to inefficient
Caesar.txt:law enforcement and the lack of street lighting.
Caesar.txt:Despite these drawbacks, London was the cultural, political, and social heart of England. As the
Caesar.txt:home of the monarch and most of England’s trade,
Caesar.txt:London was a bustling metropolis. Not surprisingly,
Caesar.txt:a young Shakespeare moved to London to begin his
Caesar.txt:professional career.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The theatre
Caesar.txt:Most theatres were not actually located within the
Caesar.txt:city of London. Rather, theatre owners built them
Caesar.txt:on the South bank of the Thames River (in Southwark) across from the city in order to avoid the strict
Caesar.txt:regulations that applied within the city’s walls. These
Caesar.txt:restrictions stemmed from a mistrust of public performances as locations of plague and riotous behavior. Furthermore, because theatre performances took
Caesar.txt:place during the day, they took laborers away from
Caesar.txt:their jobs. Opposition to the theatres also came from
Caesar.txt:Puritans who believed that they fostered immorality.
Caesar.txt:Therefore, theatres moved out of the city, to areas
Caesar.txt:near other sites of restricted activities, such as dog
Caesar.txt:fighting, bear- and bull-baiting, and prostitution.
Caesar.txt:Despite the move, the theatre was not free from
Caesar.txt:censorship or regulation. In fact, a branch of the government known as the Office of the Revels
Caesar.txt:attempted to ensure that plays did not present politically or socially sensitive material. Prior to each performance, the Master of the Revels would read a
Caesar.txt:complete text of each play, cutting out offending sections or, in some cases, not approving the play for
Caesar.txt:public performance.

Caesar.txt:They were usually open-air,

Caesar.txt:rectangular stage extended
Caesar.txt:out into an area that people
Caesar.txt:called the pit — a circular,
Caesar.txt:uncovered area about 70 feet
Caesar.txt:in diameter. Audience members had two choices when
Caesar.txt:purchasing admission to a

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Actors and staging
Caesar.txt:Performances in Shakespeare’s England do not
Caesar.txt:appear to have employed scenery. However, theatre
Caesar.txt:companies developed their costumes with great care
Caesar.txt:and expense. In fact, a playing company’s costumes
Caesar.txt:were its most valuable items. These extravagant costumes were the object of much controversy because
Caesar.txt:some aristocrats feared that the actors could use them
Caesar.txt:to disguise their social status on the streets of London.
Caesar.txt:Costumes also disguised a player’s gender. All
Caesar.txt:actors on the stage during Shakespeare’s lifetime were
Caesar.txt:men. Young boys whose voices had not reached
Caesar.txt:maturity played female parts. This practice no doubt
Caesar.txt:influenced Shakespeare’s and his contemporary playwrights’ thematic explorations of cross-dressing.
Caesar.txt:Though historians have managed to reconstruct
Caesar.txt:the appearance of the early modern theatre, such as
Caesar.txt:the recent construction of the Globe in London,
Caesar.txt:much of the information regarding how plays were
Caesar.txt:performed during this era has been lost. Scholars of
Caesar.txt:Early Modern theatre have turned to the scant external and internal stage directions in manuscripts in
Caesar.txt:an effort to find these answers. Although a hindrance
Caesar.txt:for modern critics and scholars, the lack of detail
Caesar.txt:about Early Modern performances has allowed modern directors and actors a great deal of flexibility and
Caesar.txt:room to be creative.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The printing press
Caesar.txt:If not for the printing press, many Early Modern
Caesar.txt:plays may not have survived until today. In Shakespeare’s time, printers produced all books by sheet —
Caesar.txt:a single large piece of paper that the printer would
Caesar.txt:fold in order to produce the desired book size. For
Caesar.txt:example, a folio required folding the sheet once, a
Caesar.txt:quarto four times, an octavo eight, and so on. Sheets
Caesar.txt:would be printed one side at a time; thus, printers
Caesar.txt:had to simultaneously print multiple nonconsecutive pages.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In order to estimate what section of the text
Caesar.txt:would be on each page, the printer would cast off
Caesar.txt:copy. After the printer made these estimates, compositors would set the type upside down, letter by letter. This process of setting type produced textual
Caesar.txt:errors, some of which a proofreader would catch.
Caesar.txt:When a proofreader found an error, the compositors
Caesar.txt:would fix the piece or pieces of type. Printers called
Caesar.txt:corrections made after printing began stop-press corrections because they literally had to stop the press
Caesar.txt:to fix the error. Because of the high cost of paper,
Caesar.txt:printers would still sell the sheets printed before they
Caesar.txt:made the correction.
Caesar.txt:Printers placed frames of text in the bed of the
Caesar.txt:printing press and used them to imprint the paper.
Caesar.txt:They then folded and grouped the sheets of paper
Caesar.txt:into gatherings, after which the pages were ready for
Caesar.txt:sale. The buyer had the option of getting the new
Caesar.txt:play bound.
Caesar.txt:The printing process was crucial to the preservation of Shakespeare’s works, but the printing of
Caesar.txt:drama in Early Modern England was not a standardized practice. Many of the first editions of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s plays appear in quarto format and,
Caesar.txt:until recently, scholars regarded them as “corrupt.”
Caesar.txt:In fact, scholars still debate how close a relationship
Caesar.txt:exists between what appeared on the stage in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and what appears
Caesar.txt:on the printed page. The inconsistent and scant
Caesar.txt:appearance of stage directions, for example, makes it
Caesar.txt:difficult to determine how close this relationship was.
Caesar.txt:We know that the practice of the theatre allowed
Caesar.txt:the alteration of plays by a variety of hands other
Caesar.txt:than the author’s, further complicating any efforts to
Caesar.txt:extract what a playwright wrote and what was
Caesar.txt:changed by either the players, the printers, or the
Caesar.txt:government censors. Theatre was a collaborative
Caesar.txt:environment. Rather than lament our inability to
Caesar.txt:determine authorship and what exactly Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:wrote, we should work to understand this collaborative nature and learn from it.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The text of Julius Caesar exists in only one form
Caesar.txt:as it was printed in the 1623 Folio collection of the
Caesar.txt:plays. Based on the number of stage directions
Caesar.txt:included in the script, the compositors were most
Caesar.txt:likely working from a theatrical prompt book or a
Caesar.txt:copy of that document.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare wrote his plays for the stage, and
Caesar.txt:the existing published texts reflect the collaborative
Caesar.txt:nature of the theatre as well as the unavoidable
Caesar.txt:changes made during the printing process. A play’s
Caesar.txt:first written version would have been the author’s
Caesar.txt:foul papers, which invariably consisted of blotted lines
Caesar.txt:and revised text. From there, a scribe would recopy
Caesar.txt:the play and produce a fair copy. The theatre manager would then copy out and annotate this copy
Caesar.txt:into a playbook (what people today call a promptbook).
Caesar.txt:At this point, scrolls of individual parts were
Caesar.txt:copied out for actors to memorize. (Due to the high

Caesar.txt:INTRODUCTION TO
Caesar.txt:JULIUS CAESAR
Caesar.txt:The seemingly straightforward simplicity of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar has made it a perennial favorite for almost
Caesar.txt:400 years. Despite its simplicity, almost Roman in
Caesar.txt:nature, the play is rich both dramatically and thematically, and every generation since Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:time has been able to identify with some political
Caesar.txt:aspect of the play. The Victorians found a stoic, sympathetic character in Brutus and found Caesar unforgivably weak and tyrannical. As we move into the
Caesar.txt:twenty-first century, audiences and readers, familiar
Caesar.txt:with leaders having public imperfections, are more
Caesar.txt:forgiving of Caesar and are often suspicious of Brutus’ moralistic posturing. The play has also formed
Caesar.txt:most modern readers’ opinions and views of ancient
Caesar.txt:Rome and Romans. In the article, “Shakespeare and
Caesar.txt:the Elizabethan Romans,” published in Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:Survey #10 in 1957, critic T.J.B. Spencer wrote, “The
Caesar.txt:part played by Shakespeare himself in creating our
Caesar.txt:notions of the ancient Romans should not be forgotten . . . we are all in the power of Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:imagination, a power which has been exercised for
Caesar.txt:several generations and from which it is scarcely possible to extricate ourselves.”
Caesar.txt:The structure of the play follows closely the pattern of the typical Elizabethan revenge play but varies
Caesar.txt:in form from Shakespeare’s other history plays.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Revenge plays, extremely popular in the theatre of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s day, dealt with the retribution of an
Caesar.txt:evil act. For example, a murder was always punished
Caesar.txt:by another murder and often under the auspices of
Caesar.txt:the original victim’s ghost. The person who committed the first murder, regardless of personal honor
Caesar.txt:or motives, was doomed from the beginning. Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar, a play that deals with actual historical events,
Caesar.txt:differs somewhat from the plays that Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:wrote about English history. As Judah Stampfer
Caesar.txt:points out in The Tragic Engagement: A Study of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s Classical Tragedies, Shakespeare’s English history plays sought to establish some sort of
Caesar.txt:legitimacy by the end of the play. But Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:consists of one illegitimate act after another. Caesar
Caesar.txt:overthrows Pompey and damages the republic. Brutus and the other conspirators plot to assassinate Caesar, mob rule is tolerated, Antony instructs Octavius
Caesar.txt:in Machiavellian ethics and the play ends with
Caesar.txt:Octavius positioning for authority, with civil war
Caesar.txt:imminent.
Caesar.txt:The majority of Shakespeare’s plays are written
Caesar.txt:in blank verse and Julius Caesar is no exception.
Caesar.txt:Blank verse is a form of poetry in iambic pentameter. Each line has ten syllables — five unstressed syllables alternating with five stressed syllables.
Caesar.txt:Occasionally, a word that is usually pronounced as
Caesar.txt:one syllable is accompanied by a grave accent. The
Caesar.txt:accent is an indication that the word should be spoken with two syllables. For example, the word
Caesar.txt:“moved,” usually one syllable, with a grave accent
Caesar.txt:would be pronounced as “move-ed.” This allows the
Caesar.txt:line to fall correctly into the rhythm of the iambic
Caesar.txt:pentameter.
Caesar.txt:During the Renaissance, there was a rekindling
Caesar.txt:of interest in ancient Roman literature and art. Thus,
Caesar.txt:the subject matter was of great interest to Elizabethan
Caesar.txt:audiences. Shakespeare wrote a total of four plays set
Caesar.txt:in ancient Rome. In addition to Julius Caesar, Shakespeare’s Roman plays include Titus Andronicus,
Caesar.txt:Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus. Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:was especially interested in the character of Julius
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar and mentions him consistently in his other
Caesar.txt:plays, including Hamlet, Richard III, As You Like It,
Caesar.txt:Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2, and Henry VI, Parts 2 and 3.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Date and text
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar is speculated to be Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:twenty-first play, written at the end of the cycle of
Caesar.txt:history plays and just before Hamlet. The play was
Caesar.txt:first performed, and thus, thought to have been written, in 1599 and may have been the premier show
Caesar.txt:of the newly rebuilt Globe Theatre. This date is
Caesar.txt:based on the journal of a Swiss traveler, Thomas Platter, who was visiting England between September 18
Caesar.txt:and October 20, 1599, and attended two plays. In
Caesar.txt:his journal, translated by Ernest Schanzer in the article, “Thomas Platter’s Observations on the Elizabethan Stage,” published in Notes & Queries in 1956,
Caesar.txt:Platter described one of the plays that he saw and
Caesar.txt:many scholars believe he is writing about Shakespeare’s play, Julius Caesar, being performed at The
Caesar.txt:Globe:
Caesar.txt:After lunch on September 21st, at about two o’clock, I
Caesar.txt:and my party crossed the river, and there in the house
Caesar.txt:with the thatched roof we saw an excellent
Caesar.txt:performance of the tragedy of the first Emperor Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar with about fifteen characters; after the play,
Caesar.txt:according to their custom they did a most elegant and
Caesar.txt:curious dance, two dressed in men’s clothes, and two
Caesar.txt:in women’s.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Not published during Shakespeare’s lifetime,
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar appeared for the first time seven years
Caesar.txt:after his death in the First Folio of 1623. The play
Caesar.txt:appeared in the Folio as The Tragedy of Julius Caesar but was listed as The Life and Death of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar in the table of contents. The text of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar, as it appears in the Folio, is relatively errorfree and has the reputation of being the least corrupt
Caesar.txt:text printed in the Folio. Because the play is so rich
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:in stage directions, it is thought that the compositors of the 1623 Folio were most likely working
Caesar.txt:from a prompt book or a transcript of that document. A prompt book is a copy of the text used by
Caesar.txt:the stage manager of a theatre. It is marked with
Caesar.txt:character entrances and exits, blocking, props, and
Caesar.txt:special effects such as offstage shouts, music, or
Caesar.txt:sounds of thunder and lightening.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s sources
Caesar.txt:The majority of Shakespeare’s information about the
Caesar.txt:people and events in Julius Caesar was taken from
Caesar.txt:the work of the Greek historian, Plutarch (46?–120?
Caesar.txt:A.D.). Sir Thomas North, working from the French
Caesar.txt:version of Plutarch’s works translated by Jacques
Caesar.txt:Amyot, published an English language version of
Caesar.txt:Plutarch’s Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans in
Caesar.txt:1579. It was reprinted in 1595 with minimal changes
Caesar.txt:and again in 1603 with the addition of the life of
Caesar.txt:Octavius Caesar. Working from North’s translations,
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare used material from the Lives of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar, Marcus Antonius, and Marcus Brutus.
Caesar.txt:Because Plutarch was as interested in the moral
Caesar.txt:characteristics of his subjects as he was in the historical facts, Shakespeare found very useful information
Caesar.txt:in the stories that would translate well onto the theatrical stage. Plutarch’s telling of the lives of Caesar,
Caesar.txt:Antony, and Brutus is rich with anecdotes about the
Caesar.txt:characters as well as descriptions of appearance and
Caesar.txt:personality traits. Being the consummate playwright,
Caesar.txt:however, Shakespeare was able to embellish the stories adding compressed action, heightened drama,
Caesar.txt:and powerful speeches as well as internal and external conflict.
Caesar.txt:Many speeches from the play are taken directly
Caesar.txt:from North’s translation and are only rephrased to
Caesar.txt:fit into blank verse. For example, in the Life of Brutus, Plutarch records Brutus as saying, “It rejoiceth
Caesar.txt:my heart, that not one of my friends hath failed me
Caesar.txt:at my need.” Shakespeare has Brutus say, “My heart
Caesar.txt:doth joy that yet in all my life / I found no man but
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:19
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:was true to me” (V.5.34–35). The Forum speeches,
Caesar.txt:as delivered by Brutus and Antony, are results of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s imagination and proof of his enduring
Caesar.txt:genius.
Caesar.txt:Other sources that Shakespeare may have used
Caesar.txt:for Julius Caesar include a biography of Julius Caesar by John Higgins in A Mirror for Magistrates and
Caesar.txt:Chaucer’s “The Monk’s Tale” from The Canterbury
Caesar.txt:Tales, in which Brutus and Cassius are seen as spiteful assassins and Caesar becomes an honorable sacrifice. Shakespeare my also have been influenced by
Caesar.txt:Dante’s Divine Comedy, in which Brutus and Cassius are seen in the lowest circle of hell alongside
Caesar.txt:Judas Iscariot.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Performance history
Caesar.txt:The first performance of Julius Caesar occurred in
Caesar.txt:1599. According to the Swiss traveler, Thomas Platter, the play was “very well acted” and “elaborately
Caesar.txt:costumed.” Although most costuming in Elizabethan
Caesar.txt:theatres was minimal, it is conjectured that there was
Caesar.txt:some classical costuming in the production of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar including the use of breastplates and plumed
Caesar.txt:helmets. The play was extremely popular with the
Caesar.txt:original audience and Leonard Digges wrote about
Caesar.txt:the enthusiastic audiences for the play as late as the
Caesar.txt:1620s. There is proof that the play was performed at
Caesar.txt:Whitehall in 1611 and 1612, at Saint James in January of 1636 and at the Cock Pit in the same year.
Caesar.txt:The play was performed for Charles I in 1637 and
Caesar.txt:remained an audience favorite right up to 1642 when
Caesar.txt:the theatres were closed because of the English
Caesar.txt:Civil War.
Caesar.txt:When Charles II was restored to the throne in
Caesar.txt:1660, the theatres were reopened. Julius Caesar was
Caesar.txt:included in the repertoire of Thomas Kilgrew’s Company in the 1660s and was one of the few plays written by Shakespeare that remained popular in the late
Caesar.txt:seventeenth century. With many changes to the
Caesar.txt:script and alterations to the major characters, Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar continued to draw audiences into the theatre.

Caesar.txt:From 1708 to 1728 the character of Brutus took
Caesar.txt:center stage in productions of the play. Famous
Caesar.txt:actors of the time, such as Thomas Betterton, Barton Booth, and James Quin all took their turns playing the character that was being performed as the
Caesar.txt:stoical and dignified hero of the play. The text was
Caesar.txt:often altered so that Caesar became a frightening
Caesar.txt:tyrant and the character of Antony was restructured
Caesar.txt:to be a freedom fighter, played by such luminaries as
Caesar.txt:Edward Kynaston, Robert Wilks, and William Milward. The play was often cut and rearranged to make
Caesar.txt:the focus of the play a battle between good and evil
Caesar.txt:or ambition and liberty. Fearing the audience’s reaction to the violence, the scene with Cinna the poet
Caesar.txt:was cut so as not to offend the audience; Portia’s gash
Caesar.txt:was moved from her thigh to her arm for the same
Caesar.txt:reason. During the years of 1750–1780, Julius Caesar was revived almost every year with 150 performances in London.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The play, appealing
Caesar.txt:to the ideals of the early
Caesar.txt:American settlers, was
Caesar.txt:first performed in America on June 1, 1770, in
Caesar.txt:Philadelphia. An advertisement for the play read:
Caesar.txt:“The noble struggles for
Caesar.txt:liberty by that renowned
Caesar.txt:patriot, Marcus Brutus.”
Caesar.txt:America’s connection to
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar took an
Caesar.txt:interesting turn during
Caesar.txt:the American Civil War.
Caesar.txt:President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by a
Caesar.txt:member of one of the
Caesar.txt:most famous acting families of the time, John
Caesar.txt:Wilkes Booth. Booth’s
Caesar.txt:father, Junius Brutus
Caesar.txt:Booth, was named after the Brutus who had murdered Julius Caesar. Both John Wilkes and his father
Caesar.txt:Junius Brutus performed in a benefit performance of
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar, staged to raise money to erect a statue
Caesar.txt:of William Shakespeare in New York’s Central Park
Caesar.txt:on November 25, 1864. Four months later, during
Caesar.txt:a performance of Our American Cousin, John Wilkes
Caesar.txt:Booth shot and killed President Lincoln. Booth
Caesar.txt:jumped from the president’s box to the stage shouting the motto of the state of Virginia, “Sic Semper
Caesar.txt:Tyrannis” (Thus Be It Ever To Tyrants).
Caesar.txt:Great scenic spectacles that prided themselves
Caesar.txt:on realistic sets, lavish costumes, and huge crowds of
Caesar.txt:people on stage (as opposed to focusing on the content of the script being performed) dominated the
Caesar.txt:theatre in the early nineteenth century. John Phillip
Caesar.txt:Kemble, working at the Theatre Royal and Covent
Caesar.txt:Garden, turned Julius Caesar into a sensational event
Caesar.txt:that was visually stunning but again altered Shakespeare’s script to fit the mores and ideals of the time.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Introduction to Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Brutus remained a lofty patriot and the scene in
Caesar.txt:which Antony and Octavius mark people for death
Caesar.txt:was cut. Herbert Beerbohm Tree, managing Her
Caesar.txt:Majesty’s Theatre in 1898, cut both scenes and characters to make Antony the star of the play and his
Caesar.txt:production became the defining production of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar for the next twenty years. W. C. Macready,
Caesar.txt:who played at one time or another both Brutus and
Caesar.txt:Cassius, maintained the grandiose style of Kemble
Caesar.txt:and Tree but, seeing the richness of the characters as
Caesar.txt:drawn by Shakespeare, began to play the men as
Caesar.txt:written with both their positive and negative qualities. He also made the assassination scene realistic
Caesar.txt:and bloody and set the stage for the reinstatement of
Caesar.txt:the “original” text in the twentieth century.
Caesar.txt:In Act III, Scene 1, of Julius Caesar, Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:has Cassius ask, “How many ages hence / Shall this
Caesar.txt:our lofty scene be acted over / In states unborn and
Caesar.txt:accents yet unknown!” Reviewing the twentieth century productions of Julius Caesar, one might be
Caesar.txt:tempted to add prophet to Shakespeare’s list of
Caesar.txt:accomplishments. With the majority of the text
Caesar.txt:restored to Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:script, the themes and
Caesar.txt:character conflicts begin
Caesar.txt:to take precedence over
Caesar.txt:the visual presentation.
Caesar.txt:Modern producers and
Caesar.txt:directors became aware of
Caesar.txt:the contemporary nature
Caesar.txt:of the themes in Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar and productions of
Caesar.txt:the twentieth century
Caesar.txt:reflected that discovery.
Caesar.txt:On the modern stage,
Caesar.txt:Caesar has become versions of Hitler, Mussolini,
Caesar.txt:and Fidel Castro. In a

Caesar.txt:The crowds have at times become Nazi rallies and
Caesar.txt:audiences have actually been encouraged to participate as members of the mob in several productions.
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s influence after his death has been represented with huge statues left on stage to tower over
Caesar.txt:the action and, in 1957, Glenn Byam Shaw, in his
Caesar.txt:production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in
Caesar.txt:Stratford, England, projected a star that was prominent during the funeral scene and again over the
Caesar.txt:plains of Philippi. Julius Caesar, along with all of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s plays, with their universal themes and
Caesar.txt:uncanny understanding of human nature, will continue to find a place on the stage and in the hearts of
Caesar.txt:audiences everywhere.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Criticism
Caesar.txt:The first critics, writing at the end of the seventeenth
Caesar.txt:century, were not kind to Julius Caesar. Critics such
Caesar.txt:as Thomas Rymer and John Dennis expressed their
Caesar.txt:dissatisfaction with the minor role that Caesar had
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:22
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:in a play that bore his name and with what they felt
Caesar.txt:were historical inaccuracies. Writing in 1817,
Caesar.txt:William Hazlitt, in his book, Characters of Shakespeares Plays, disapproved of the fact that Caesar, as
Caesar.txt:drawn by Shakespeare, was not like “the portrait
Caesar.txt:given of him in his commentaries.”
Caesar.txt:In addition to what many felt was the disregard
Caesar.txt:of the unity of time, place, and action, the major
Caesar.txt:complaint in much of the early criticism of the play
Caesar.txt:lay with the hero. If Julius Caesar, as written by
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare, was the hero of the play, he was, at best,
Caesar.txt:a deficient hero. Charles Gildon in his preface to
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar in Nicholas Rowe’s 1710 edition of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s works, claimed that the true hero of
Caesar.txt:the piece was Brutus and that opinion held for
Caesar.txt:almost 200 years. Samuel Johnson exonerated the
Caesar.txt:play in his Preface of 1765 and Herman Ulrici, writing in 1839, found a thematic unity to the play never
Caesar.txt:acknowledged before. This led to a renewed interest
Caesar.txt:in the play by critics in the nineteenth century.
Caesar.txt:In the early twentieth century, critics such as
Caesar.txt:M.W. MacCallum began studying the play as it
Caesar.txt:referred to Plutarch, finding a new historical interest in Shakespeare’s source material. G. Wilson
Caesar.txt:Knight, writing in the 1930s, discovered much of
Caesar.txt:interest in Shakespeare’s use of language and imagery;
Caesar.txt:the characters of Caesar and Brutus were appreciated
Caesar.txt:for their human ambiguities during this time period
Caesar.txt:by such critics as Dover Wilson. Character study
Caesar.txt:gave way to the examination of the play’s moral and
Caesar.txt:political themes, and critics such as Harley GranvilleBarker in 1947 and R.A. Foakes in 1954 found the
Caesar.txt:play’s unity in its political themes. In the latter part
Caesar.txt:of the twentieth century, the play and its political
Caesar.txt:overtones underwent scrutiny by both the New Historicists and the Cultural Materialists. Coppelia
Caesar.txt:Kahn in her 1997 book, Roman Shakespeare: Warriors, Wounds and Women, gives a very interesting
Caesar.txt:look at the Roman plays, including Julius Caesar,
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:from a feminist perspective. As Shakespearean criticism moves into the twenty-first century, there seems
Caesar.txt:to be a movement towards reexamining Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:in the context in which it was written. As David
Caesar.txt:Scott Kastan writes in Shakespeare After Theory
Caesar.txt:(1999), the movement is to:
Caesar.txt:...restore Shakespeare’s artistry to the earliest conditions
Caesar.txt:of its realization and intelligibility: to the
Caesar.txt:collaborations of the theater in which the plays were
Caesar.txt:acted, to the practices of the book trade in which they
Caesar.txt:were published, to the unstable political world of late
Caesar.txt:Tudor and early Stuart England in which the plays
Caesar.txt:were engaged by their various publics.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he play opens on a scene of raucous public celebration. Not only is it February 15, the Feast of the
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:Lupercal, but it is also the day Julius Caesar triumphantly returns from Spain after defeating the last of
Caesar.txt:Rome’s external adversaries. The crowd of revelers is
Caesar.txt:happy to have a day away from their usual tasks and,
Caesar.txt:because the day is considered a high festival, plenty of
Caesar.txt:government-supplied food and drink is available for all.
Caesar.txt:The Lupercalian holiday, an ancient rite of both purgation and fertility, honored the gods Lupercus and
Caesar.txt:Faunus as well as the twin brothers Romulus and
Caesar.txt:Remus, the legendary founders of Rome. It seems
Caesar.txt:appropriate that Shakespeare chose this particular
Caesar.txt:feast as the setting for the return of Julius Caesar to
Caesar.txt:Rome. Historically, Caesar returned from Spain in October of 45 B.C., but by dramatically compressing the
Caesar.txt:events, Shakespeare draws a comparison between
Caesar.txt:Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, and Caesar,
Caesar.txt:the founder of a new Roman order. By implication, the
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:religious festival, combined with Caesar’s ceremonial
Caesar.txt:entrance into the city, gives Caesar an immediate godlike aura and would possibly remind the viewer of
Caesar.txt:Jesus’ triumphant entrance into Jerusalem before his
Caesar.txt:betrayal and death on the cross.
Caesar.txt:The merriment of the Roman people is short-lived,
Caesar.txt:however, as the scene is quickly broken up by the intrusion of two Roman Tribunes, Marullus and Flavius. The
Caesar.txt:two men insult the crowd and admonish them for being
Caesar.txt:idle on a workday. They also question why the commoners walk about “without the sign of your profession.” This is a reference to an Elizabethan law that
Caesar.txt:required workers to identify themselves by wearing their
Caesar.txt:work clothes and carrying the tools of their trade.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare often used Elizabethan references in his
Caesar.txt:plays, regardless of the actual timeframe in which the
Caesar.txt:story was taking place, as a way of making his work
Caesar.txt:more accessible to his audience. Another example of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare using Elizabethan references in this scene
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:30
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act I, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Although the majority of the people of Rome are happy
Caesar.txt:with their leader, some are not. This small-scale conflict
Caesar.txt:will be reflected in the next scene when the full-blown
Caesar.txt:conspiracy against Caesar begins to take shape. Shakespeare also uses the first scene in the play to establish
Caesar.txt:“the mob” as a character with its own life and set of
Caesar.txt:characteristics, who can be moved to change its mind
Caesar.txt:about an issue with a few well-chosen words.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:A relief of Romulus and Remus, from the 1st century, A.D.
Caesar.txt:Mark Smith/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:is the reference to towers and chimney tops. There
Caesar.txt:were no towers or chimneys in ancient Rome, but these
Caesar.txt:anachronisms, chronologically misplaced events, words
Caesar.txt:or details, bring the play into alignment with the experiences of the audience for whom the play was written.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Finally, the scene introduces one of the many images
Caesar.txt:that enhances the play as well as one of the play’s recurring themes. The word “blood,” implying the dual meaning of “life-nourishing” and “death-inducing,” is used
Caesar.txt:consistently throughout the play. Here, Caesar has triumphed over Pompey’s blood, but there will soon be a time
Caesar.txt:when Caesar’s body, lying bloody at the base of Pompey’s
Caesar.txt:statue, will be triumphed by Pompey. This image illustrates
Caesar.txt:a theme in Julius Caesar, that blood begets blood.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare wrote the majority of his plays in blank
Caesar.txt:verse, but he often changed from verse to prose to indicate the social status of a character. In this scene, the
Caesar.txt:tribunes speak verse and the commoners use prose. In
Caesar.txt:a delightful bit of wordplay, the Carpenter and the Cobbler frustrate the Tribunes with their evasive puns and
Caesar.txt:bawdy innuendoes. Puns, a play on words that are
Caesar.txt:spelled or sound the same but have different meanings,
Caesar.txt:have often been called the lowest form of humor, but
Caesar.txt:Elizabethan audiences delighted in them.
Caesar.txt:In general, the crowd is content with the harmony
Caesar.txt:and abundance in their lives and is more concerned
Caesar.txt:with parties than with politics. Infuriated by the mob’s
Caesar.txt:indifference, Marullus questions the crowd’s memories
Caesar.txt:and motivations. How is Caesar’s returning from the
Caesar.txt:defeat of another Roman a victory? Marullus also
Caesar.txt:underscores the fickleness of the people by reminding
Caesar.txt:them that it was not so long ago that they stood in the
Caesar.txt:very same place celebrating the return of Pompey but
Caesar.txt:now celebrate the return of the man who, “comes in triumph over Pompey’s blood.” The Tribunes scold the
Caesar.txt:onlookers and suggest that the gods should send a
Caesar.txt:plague for this type of ingratitude and the chastised
Caesar.txt:crowd silently and guiltily disperses.
Caesar.txt:The conflict between the factions of commoner and
Caesar.txt:official serves two dramatic functions. First, Shakespeare puts the central conflict of the play into place.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar enters with his procession, which includes, among others, his
Caesar.txt:warns him to “Beware the Ides of March.” Caesar dismisses the man as a
Caesar.txt:dreamer and moves on to begin the festivities for the Feast Day. Left
Caesar.txt:behind are two men, Brutus and Cassius. Cassius strikes up a
Caesar.txt:conversation with Brutus and learns that Brutus is not happy with
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s sharp rise to power. Cassius, also wary of Caesar’s power,
Caesar.txt:attempts to enlist support from Brutus in an effort to do something about
Caesar.txt:Caesar before the people crown him king, giving him absolute power.
Caesar.txt:While Brutus and Cassius are having this conversation, shouts are heard
Caesar.txt:from offstage. Antony has offered the crown to Caesar and he has refused
Caesar.txt:it in a ploy to make the people of Rome beg him to take the crown.
Caesar.txt:Instead, the people cheer his decision and Caesar is forced to reject the
Caesar.txt:crown a total of three times. The anger he must suppress causes Caesar
Caesar.txt:to suffer an epileptic seizure. Cassius uses Caesar’s weaknesses to
Caesar.txt:persuade Brutus to join in the conspiracy against Caesar. The two men
Caesar.txt:agree to meet at a later time to discuss the matter more fully.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he disparity between the public image and the private man is central to Julius Caesar, and this introT
Caesar.txt:duction to Caesar certainly underscores Shakespeare’s
Caesar.txt:ability to understand and portray the complex and often
Caesar.txt:dual nature of human beings. Despite the debate that
Caesar.txt:has raged for years over who is the actual “hero” of
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar, no clear-cut protagonist ever emerges in
Caesar.txt:the play. The simplistic beauty of this drama lies in the
Caesar.txt:fact that, just like life off of the stage, politicians and
Caesar.txt:public figures, no matter how the populace chooses to
Caesar.txt:see them, are mere mortals with the same ailments and
Caesar.txt:torments, delusions and misjudgments as the common
Caesar.txt:person.
Caesar.txt:A great flourish of trumpets signals the arrival of
Caesar.txt:Caesar and his entourage. A large crowd of people that
Caesar.txt:includes both friends and foes accompanies him.

Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar depicted as a deity in his chariot.
Caesar.txt:Mary Evans Picture Library
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Although they speak no lines and are never referred to,
Caesar.txt:the stage directions indicate that Marullus and Flavius,
Caesar.txt:the chastising tribunes from the previous scene, are
Caesar.txt:part of this crowd, possibly as prisoners having already
Caesar.txt:been arrested for desecrating Caesar’s statues. The two
Caesar.txt:men in chains would serve as a potent visual image of
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s power and control over attempts to undermine
Caesar.txt:his authority. Also in the crowd are Caesar’s right-hand
Caesar.txt:man, Marc Antony, and the men who will become the
Caesar.txt:prevailing forces of the conspiracy against Caesar.
Caesar.txt:Marc Antony, also known as Marcus Antonius, was
Caesar.txt:related to Julius Caesar on his mother’s side. He had
Caesar.txt:been a staunch supporter of Caesar during the conflicts
Caesar.txt:with Pompey and had served in Caesar’s army when he

Caesar.txt:Act I, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Lupercal. During the holiday, priests of the Lupercus,
Caesar.txt:dressed in loincloths made of goatskin, sacrificed goats
Caesar.txt:and a dog and smeared themselves with sacrificial
Caesar.txt:blood. They then ran through the city carrying a goatskin
Caesar.txt:thong, called a februa. Women placed themselves in
Caesar.txt:such a way that the priests could strike them with the
Caesar.txt:februa, thus assuring the women of fertility and easy
Caesar.txt:childbirth. In this short exchange, Shakespeare makes
Caesar.txt:apparent Antony’s exalted position not only as a priest
Caesar.txt:of the Luperci but as a loyal and dedicated follower of
Caesar.txt:Antony’s reply, “When Caesar says ‘Do this,’ it is performed,” explicitly defines the depth of his allegiance to
Caesar.txt:the leader of Rome.
Caesar.txt:friend of Pompey’s, indicating that the marriage was
Caesar.txt:most likely politically motivated. Indeed, a young,
Caesar.txt:healthy bride should have been able to produce the heir
Caesar.txt:that Caesar surely desires to guarantee the continuation of his reign as leader of Rome. Caesar’s rather
Caesar.txt:gives several clues to Caesar’s character and his motivations. First, he must maintain his own public image by
Caesar.txt:lack of children on his wife. However, the “sterile curse”
Caesar.txt:could be Caesar’s own aging impotence that prevents
Caesar.txt:Plutarch, Shakespeare’s main source for much of this
Caesar.txt:play, “The chiefest cause that made [Caesar] mortally
Caesar.txt:hated was the covetous desire he had to be called
Caesar.txt:king.” Caesar’s obvious desire to produce a male heir
Caesar.txt:may indicate that Caesar was indeed thinking along
Caesar.txt:those lines.
Caesar.txt:Just as Caesar makes it obvious that he believes in
Caesar.txt:the superstition attached to the Lupercal to cure
Caesar.txt:interrupted by the warnings of a soothsayer, a man who
Caesar.txt:sees into the future. Both the Romans of Caesar’s time
Caesar.txt:and the Elizabethans who saw the play enacted on the
Caesar.txt:stage of The Globe were very superstitious and would
Caesar.txt:have appreciated the import of prophecies, dreams, and
Caesar.txt:omens, and anticipated the dire results when those
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:signs were ignored. Here, Caesar is warned to “Beware
Caesar.txt:the Ides of March,” but despite the fact that he has
Caesar.txt:proven to be a superstitious man when it pertains to
Caesar.txt:others, he chooses to ignore the warning and dismisses
Caesar.txt:the soothsayer as nothing more than a dreamer. Ironically, Cassius, the man who repeats the soothsayer’s
Caesar.txt:warning to Caesar, is the very man who will help to
Caesar.txt:make the prophecy come true.
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s brief exchange with the soothsayer provides more insights into Caesar’s character. He is a man
Caesar.txt:who will tempt the fates by ignoring the messages
Caesar.txt:passed to him by the soothsayer. In essence, Caesar
Caesar.txt:seems to have put himself on a par with the gods, in
Caesar.txt:control of destiny as opposed to being controlled by it.
Caesar.txt:This arrogance would have been a red flag to Elizabethan audiences that Caesar was setting himself up
Caesar.txt:for a mighty fall from grace. Also, Caesar’s use of the
Caesar.txt:third person when referring to himself suggests that
Caesar.txt:Caesar has begun to believe his own press. The references to himself combined with his disregard of
Caesar.txt:prophecy point to the fact that Caesar is actively participating in his own deification.
Caesar.txt:Followed by the crowd, Caesar leaves the stage to
Caesar.txt:watch the race. Two men, Brutus and Cassius, lag
Caesar.txt:behind and, left alone on stage, begin a dialogue that
Caesar.txt:will change the course of history. Marcus Junius Brutus, born in 85 B.C., was a nephew of Cato, one of Caesar’s most unyielding adversaries. As Cato’s nephew,
Caesar.txt:Brutus was considered an enemy of Caesar. He fought
Caesar.txt:with Pompey in Greece and was taken prisoner when
Caesar.txt:Pompey was defeated. In an effort to heal the wounds
Caesar.txt:of civil war, Caesar pardoned and set free the prisoners
Caesar.txt:of war, including Brutus. Shortly thereafter, Brutus
Caesar.txt:became a lieutenant in Caesar’s army and continued to
Caesar.txt:serve him loyally. Although Shakespeare makes no
Caesar.txt:direct mention of it in his play, it was common knowledge to most Elizabethans that Brutus’ mother, Servilia,
Caesar.txt:had had an affair with Julius Caesar. Because Brutus
Caesar.txt:was born during the time of this relationship, it was
Caesar.txt:speculated that Brutus might have actually been Caesar’s illegitimate son.
Caesar.txt:Brutus subscribed to the philosophy known as Stoicism, which maintains that the universe is completely
Caesar.txt:rational and guided by fate. Therefore, one must learn
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act I, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:to accept whatever happens with a strong and tranquil
Caesar.txt:mind. Virtue, being the attainment of valor, moral excellence, and righteousness, is the only key to a happy life
Caesar.txt:and becomes the ultimate goal of the Stoic; vice is evil
Caesar.txt:and leads only to unhappiness. Stoicism encourages a
Caesar.txt:man to be centered in his intellect while suppressing his
Caesar.txt:feelings. Brutus’ attempt to maintain his emotionless
Caesar.txt:moral superiority, based in his Stoic philosophy,
Caesar.txt:becomes a double-edged sword and ultimately leads
Caesar.txt:him — and Rome — into destruction.
Caesar.txt:Caius Cassius Longinus was also an ally of Pompey,
Caesar.txt:but when he saw that Pompey’s defeat was imminent,
Caesar.txt:he changed allegiance and, after being pardoned by
Caesar.txt:Caesar, became a soldier in Caesar’s army. Cassius,
Caesar.txt:married to Brutus’ sister Junia, was Brutus’s brother-inlaw. Unlike the Stoic Brutus, Cassius was an Epicurean.
Caesar.txt:The philosophy of Epicureanism promoted the notion
Caesar.txt:that freedom from physical pain and mental trouble was
Caesar.txt:the goal of a happy life. Again, virtue, courage, and justice were considered the attributes needed to attain
Caesar.txt:wisdom, but unlike the intellectual center of stoicism,
Caesar.txt:Epicurians felt that knowledge was derived from the
Caesar.txt:senses. Brutus’ cold and
Caesar.txt:unwavering intellect offers
Caesar.txt:a direct contrast to the
Caesar.txt:fiery, passionate nature of
Caesar.txt:Cassius. Thus, as Brutus
Caesar.txt:lived in his head, Cassius
Caesar.txt:lived in his heart. Just as
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ inability to balance
Caesar.txt:head and heart will lead to
Caesar.txt:his downfall, Cassius’
Caesar.txt:inability to balance heart
Caesar.txt:and head will also lead to
Caesar.txt:his ruin.
Caesar.txt:Much of the manipulation that occurs in Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar is achieved by the
Caesar.txt:use of flattery. In this
Caesar.txt:scene, Cassius plies Brutus
Caesar.txt:with praise and compliments. He speaks of Brutus’ worthiness and the
Caesar.txt:high respect with which he
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:43
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:is held throughout Rome and offers to mirror or reflect
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ honorable qualities for him to see. The mirror as
Caesar.txt:a reflection of the moral nature of man was a common
Caesar.txt:literary device in Renaissance literature, and Shakespeare uses this device to hold the mirror up to the
Caesar.txt:moral nature of man on many occasions throughout his
Caesar.txt:plays. More often than not, however, what is reflected
Caesar.txt:is the discord inherent in man’s sinful nature. For example, in Julius Caesar, Brutus admits that he is at war
Caesar.txt:against himself. What this internal war consists of is
Caesar.txt:revealed here in Scene 2 when the first flourishes and
Caesar.txt:shouts are heard from the crowd offstage. Brutus
Caesar.txt:admits that he fears the people have chosen Caesar as
Caesar.txt:their king but, in the same breath, swears that he loves
Caesar.txt:the man. By the end of his speech, however, it becomes
Caesar.txt:apparent that, for the determinedly Stoic Brutus, love
Caesar.txt:will never conquer or come before the need to maintain
Caesar.txt:honor.
Caesar.txt:At the admission of his fears, Cassius leaps at the
Caesar.txt:opportunity to involve Brutus in the conspiracy against
Caesar.txt:Caesar. Taking advantage of Brutus’ commitment to

Caesar.txt:Act I, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:honor and virtue, Cassius plays upon those words to
Caesar.txt:draw Brutus more deeply into the conspiracy. By pointing out Caesar’s weaknesses and physical imperfections, Cassius seeks to emphasize that Caesar is no
Caesar.txt:better than Brutus is. Cassius continues to build his
Caesar.txt:argument against Caesar by appealing not only to Brutus’ sense of patriotism to a free Rome but persists in
Caesar.txt:flattering Brutus with a reference to his valiant ancestor, who was noted for having overthrown King Tarquin
Caesar.txt:and creating the Roman Republic. Cassius’ words work
Caesar.txt:their magic and Brutus agrees that he has had similar
Caesar.txt:thoughts and would be willing to discuss the issue further at a safer and more convenient time.
Caesar.txt:In this scene, Shakespeare once again foreshadows
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s death and uses irony to underscore what will
Caesar.txt:become part of the dramatic unity of the play. In speaking of the power inherent in Caesar’s name, Cassius
Caesar.txt:says, “Conjure with ‘em: / ‘Brutus’ will start a spirit as
Caesar.txt:soon as ‘Caesar’. . . “ and indeed the irony is that it will
Caesar.txt:be Brutus, who in killing Caesar, will release his spirit.
Caesar.txt:By conjuring up Caesar’s spirit to be unleashed upon the
Caesar.txt:world, Brutus has in reality given the name of “Caesar”
Caesar.txt:more power in death than Caesar might have had in life.
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s spirit, which cannot be killed, will dominate the
Caesar.txt:second half of this play. Readers who feel the play
Caesar.txt:should have been called Marcus Brutus underestimate
Caesar.txt:the historical significance of Caesar’s continuing power
Caesar.txt:even after his death.
Caesar.txt:In Scene 2, Shakespeare first introduces the image
Caesar.txt:of fire that infuses the play from this point on. Fire,
Caesar.txt:which, like blood, can be either a destructive or a purifying force, represents passion and the ability to inflame
Caesar.txt:or enkindle. In lines 176–177, Brutus personifies the flint
Caesar.txt:that Cassius strikes in an effort to spark some sort of
Caesar.txt:flame to fire the conspiracy against Caesar.
Caesar.txt:When Caesar reenters the stage, the subdued nature
Caesar.txt:of the crowd, the red face of Caesar, and the pale looks
Caesar.txt:transpired offstage while Brutus and Cassius conversed
Caesar.txt:onstage. Cassius pulls Casca aside to inquire about the
Caesar.txt:events that have just taken place and Caesar notices
Caesar.txt:the men speaking together in whispers. From his
Caesar.txt:insights into Cassius’ character, it is evident that Caesar himself is a “great observer” who can “look through
Caesar.txt:the deeds of men,” but his pride and vanity will not allow
Caesar.txt:him to admit to the real danger that a man like Cassius
Caesar.txt:could pose.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:In this play, most of what is thought to be known
Caesar.txt:about Caesar is secondhand information passed on by
Caesar.txt:his enemies. Through their eyes, a portrait is drawn of
Caesar.txt:a vain and arrogant man who is weak and unyielding.
Caesar.txt:Historically, Julius Caesar was recorded to be an intelligent, witty, and charming man. An excellent orator and
Caesar.txt:a brilliant writer, Caesar brought about much needed
Caesar.txt:reforms in the Roman Senate, instituted the first public
Caesar.txt:library, improved the system of taxation, rebuilt cities,
Caesar.txt:and sought to have laws passed that would strengthen
Caesar.txt:the moral fabric of society. Shakespeare’s Caesar
Caesar.txt:reflects little of these redeeming qualities and remains
Caesar.txt:as human and ambiguous as the other characters in the
Caesar.txt:play. Indeed, Shakespeare seems to deliberately balance Caesar’s posturing with almost immediate confessions of weakness. For example, in lines 212–213,
Caesar.txt:Caesar proclaims “for always I am Caesar,” immediately
Caesar.txt:followed by the admission that he is partially deaf.
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s seizures, as recorded in Plutarch, and his
Caesar.txt:deafness, as invented by Shakespeare, serve a dramatic function as well as being indicators of Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:character. Caesar’s infirmities become symbolic of, or a
Caesar.txt:metaphor for, the diseases running rampant in Rome. In
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s time, the Elizabethans were very aware
Caesar.txt:of the existence of the body politic, a way of defining the
Caesar.txt:state in human terms. The leader is the head of the body
Caesar.txt:politic; the people represent the limbs. Just as Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:illnesses weaken his constitution, the state’s illnesses,
Caesar.txt:such as bipartisanism and civil disorder, weaken the
Caesar.txt:body politic.
Caesar.txt:Casca reveals to Brutus and Cassius the events that
Caesar.txt:took place off stage and caused such a show of concern from Caesar and his followers. According to the
Caesar.txt:cynical Casca, speaking in plain and straightforward
Caesar.txt:prose, Antony offered a crown of laurel leaves to Caesar, who, in a show of humility, refused it. The crowd so
Caesar.txt:cheered Caesar’s refusal of the crown that he had no
Caesar.txt:choice but to continue to refuse the laurel wreath on
Caesar.txt:three separate occasions. In Casca’s view, Caesar desperately wanted to accept the crown, and his refusal of
Caesar.txt:it was an act for the adoring crowd. Obviously, with his
Caesar.txt:red face as proof, Caesar was so angered by the
Caesar.txt:crowd’s reaction that he suffered an epileptic fit. The
Caesar.txt:common people’s love for Caesar grows to a fever pitch.
Caesar.txt:There is a need among the masses for a “Caesar,” and
Caesar.txt:for the time being, they are happy and content with this
Caesar.txt:one.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:ne month has passed since the end of the last
Caesar.txt:scene. It is now the eve of the Ides of March, and
Caesar.txt:O
Caesar.txt:a storm, unlike any ever seen, is raging in Rome. Fire
Caesar.txt:drops from the skies, bodies spontaneously combust,
Caesar.txt:lions roam the capitol, ghostly women walk the streets,
Caesar.txt:and the night owl was seen shrieking in the daylight.
Caesar.txt:Casca enters with his sword drawn and his fright is
Caesar.txt:apparent as he encounters Cicero.
Caesar.txt:Second only to Caesar, Marcus Tullius Cicero, born
Caesar.txt:in 106 B.C., was the most important man in Rome. Highly
Caesar.txt:educated in Greece, Cicero became Rome’s most prominent lawyer and orator. Despite his excellent reputation
Caesar.txt:and acclaimed achievements, Cicero was feared by
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar who made things so difficult for Cicero in
Caesar.txt:Rome that he was driven out of Italy in 59 B.C. Cicero
Caesar.txt:joined forces with Pompey, but when it became clear
Caesar.txt:that Pompey was going to be defeated, Cicero pleaded
Caesar.txt:for mercy from Caesar, and as was his habit, Caesar
Caesar.txt:pardoned Cicero. Cicero returned to Rome and to the
Caesar.txt:Senate, where he remained publicly neutral to Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:reforms of the government.
Caesar.txt:Unlike our modern theatres, with computerized special effects and state of the art sound systems, the Elizabethan theatre relied mainly on words to paint the
Caesar.txt:scenery and suggest the sounds of thunder and lightning. Elizabethan stagehands were not without a certain amount of clever inventiveness, however, and some
Caesar.txt:sound and lighting effects could be created. For example, beating drums or rolling large round bullets backstage often produced the sound of thunder. The effect
Caesar.txt:of lightning could be contrived by blowing rosin through
Caesar.txt:a candle flame to create a bright flash of fire.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare, like many other writers, uses storms
Caesar.txt:to create a mood of darkness and foreboding, but here
Caesar.txt:he takes the image one step further. The turmoil of the
Caesar.txt:heavens is directly representative of the turmoil present in the state and in the minds of men. The raging
Caesar.txt:storm, coupled with the eerie sights that Casca
Caesar.txt:describes, are signs of disharmony in heaven and on
Caesar.txt:earth. Signs and omens, by their very nature, are meant
Caesar.txt:to be interpreted and the misinterpretation and manipulation of signs and omens become important thematic
Caesar.txt:issues in Julius Caesar. The ambiguities present in the
Caesar.txt:people and the events of this play are underscored as
Caesar.txt:Cicero points out to Casca, “men may construe things
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:after their fashion / Clean from the purpose of the things
Caesar.txt:themselves.” Casca, dismayed by the storm, suggests
Caesar.txt:that there is either civil strife in heaven or the gods are
Caesar.txt:angry at the deeds of men. He fears that the gods do not
Caesar.txt:approve of what the conspirators are planning to do and
Caesar.txt:feels that the omens bode only evil and misfortune. Cassius, on the other hand, feels that the storm and the
Caesar.txt:omens are signs that the gods are angry at Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:tyranny.
Caesar.txt:In the face of the irate heavens, Casca loses his use
Caesar.txt:of sarcastic prose and begins to speak in blank verse.
Caesar.txt:The imagery of the storm as Casca describes it in lines
Caesar.txt:3–11 is infused with metaphorical references to Caesar.
Caesar.txt:He speaks of the earth that “shakes like a thing infirm”
Caesar.txt:just as the epileptic Caesar shook when he had to
Caesar.txt:refuse the crown. Casca speaks of the “ambitious
Caesar.txt:ocean” that will “swell and rage and foam.” The picture
Caesar.txt:that he draws is reminiscent of an ambitious tyrant,
Caesar.txt:whose ego is swelled by his power, one who rages at
Caesar.txt:not getting his way and ends by foaming at the mouth in
Caesar.txt:an epileptic fit.
Caesar.txt:After Cassius admonishes Casca in particular and
Caesar.txt:Rome in general for being weak and “womanish,”
Caesar.txt:Casca makes the announcement that the Senate plans
Caesar.txt:to make Caesar king in the assembly the following day.
Caesar.txt:Historically, Caesar had called the senate into an emergency session set to meet on March 15. Caesar might
Caesar.txt:have instigated the session to have the Senate approve
Caesar.txt:a declaration of war against the Parthenians. However,
Caesar.txt:some historians speculate that he was to be made King
Caesar.txt:of the Provinces with the anticipation that, as the outlying cities of Italy accepted Caesar as King, the city of
Caesar.txt:Rome would quickly follow. If the conspirators intend to
Caesar.txt:stop Caesar before he is crowned, they must do it
Caesar.txt:tomorrow before the Senate has the opportunity to
Caesar.txt:convene.
Caesar.txt:Cassius is disgusted by what he interprets as the
Caesar.txt:apathy of the Roman people, whom he sees as mere
Caesar.txt:sheep that would blindly follow their leader into whatever dangers he might lead them. Metaphorically, Cassius sees the commoners as trash and rubbish.
Caesar.txt:Recalling the image of fire, they become the “base matter” or fuel that will “illuminate” or inflame the ego of
Caesar.txt:the “vile” Caesar.
Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:Act I, Scene 3

Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Between Cassius’ interpretation of the storm as the
Caesar.txt:gods raging against Caesar’s tyranny and the fact that
Caesar.txt:Caesar may be crowned king the following day, Casca
Caesar.txt:is persuaded to join forces with Cassius. Lucius Cornelius Cinna, whose father had been Caesar’s first
Caesar.txt:father-in-law, enters the scene, and the list of the conspirators grows to include Cinna, Decius Brutus, and
Caesar.txt:Gaius Trebonius. Both Decius Brutus and Trebonius
Caesar.txt:were considered to be close friends of Julius Caesar.
Caesar.txt:Caesar had appointed Trebonius chief magistrate of
Caesar.txt:Rome, an influential and honorable position. Caesar so
Caesar.txt:loved Decius Brutus that he had named him as one of
Caesar.txt:his heirs, if no other member of his family survived him.
Caesar.txt:All of these men who are now plotting to eliminate
Caesar.txt:Caesar were indebted to him for either pardoning them
Caesar.txt:as prisoners of war and/or placing them in high positions of honor. The meaning of friendship is an issue in
Caesar.txt:this play and here we see Caesar’s so-called friends plot
Caesar.txt:against him. They will use their position as Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:friends to get close enough to Caesar to kill him.
Caesar.txt:Cassius, having forged several letters meant to influence Brutus’ decision to join the conspiracy, instructs
Caesar.txt:Cinna to place the letters where Brutus will be sure to
Caesar.txt:find them. Cinna exits to leave the letters in Brutus’
Caesar.txt:office, to place one on the statue of Brutus’ ancestor
Caesar.txt:and throw others into Brutus’ window. Just as the conspirators plan to destroy their friend Caesar, they plot
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Pompeii’s Theatre (or “Pompey’s porch,” as referred to by Cassius).
Caesar.txt:Michelle Jones/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:against their friend Brutus as well. Using dishonest
Caesar.txt:means to persuade Brutus to join in the group shows a
Caesar.txt:blatant disregard for the true meaning of friendship.
Caesar.txt:Brutus is not being wooed to join the conspiracy
Caesar.txt:because of a sense of brotherhood coming from these
Caesar.txt:other men. He is being used because the common people see him as “noble.” His presence in the conspiracy
Caesar.txt:will make the vile and immoral act of murder appear to
Caesar.txt:be an acceptable deed teeming with “virtue” and
Caesar.txt:“worthiness.”

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:S
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:cholars speculate that Hamlet was written immediately after Shakespeare finished Julius Caesar. If
Caesar.txt:that is the case, it would seem quite likely that the soulsearching Brutus became the prototype for the character of Hamlet. Just as Hamlet endlessly questions and
Caesar.txt:analyzes his actions, Brutus, in Act II, Scene 1, contemplates the ramifications of joining the conspiracy
Caesar.txt:against Julius Caesar.
Caesar.txt:Scene 1 takes place in Brutus’ garden, usually a
Caesar.txt:place of quiet tranquility where a man may commune
Caesar.txt:with nature. Tonight, however, a storm has raged in
Caesar.txt:Rome and Brutus’ private domain is, like the rest of
Caesar.txt:nature, in terrible turmoil. As in the previous scene, the
Caesar.txt:unnatural disharmony of the universe is symbolic of the
Caesar.txt:dissonance of the state and representative of the discord in Brutus’ soul. There is such chaos in the cosmos
Caesar.txt:that even time is out of joint: “I cannot by the progress
Caesar.txt:of the stars / Give guess how near to day.”
Caesar.txt:Brutus is not only unable to determine the time of
Caesar.txt:day; he also has trouble remembering what day of the
Caesar.txt:month it is. In the 1623 Folio version of the play, line 40
Caesar.txt:reads, “Is not tomorrow the first of March?” Many editors change the line to read “the Ides of March” but it
Caesar.txt:is possible that both Shakespeare and his audience
Caesar.txt:would have understood Brutus’ confusion about time.
Caesar.txt:On one level, Brutus’ inability to determine the time and
Caesar.txt:date would suggest that he is equally unable to understand the times in which he is living. The people of Rome
Caesar.txt:are happy and content with their leader and Brutus, like
Caesar.txt:Cassius in the previous scene, will refuse to see that.
Caesar.txt:His confusion with time could also be a direct reference
Caesar.txt:to a major political issue occurring in England and
Caesar.txt:throughout Europe at the time Julius Caesar was written.
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar is credited with creating the Julian
Caesar.txt:calendar and Plutarch suggests that many of Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:detractors cited the new calendar as evidence against
Caesar.txt:him. They claimed his implementation of the calendar
Caesar.txt:was proof of his tyrannical tendencies and that his
Caesar.txt:manipulation of time was an interference with the true
Caesar.txt:course of nature. By the year 1582, the Julian calendar
Caesar.txt:had drifted ten days out of phase and Pope Gregory
Caesar.txt:decreed the reform of the existing calendar. The
Caesar.txt:Catholic followers of the Pope adopted the new calen-
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:dar whereas the Protestants rejected it. The issue of
Caesar.txt:calendar reform became an intense political struggle in
Caesar.txt:Europe. By 1598, the year before Shakespeare is
Caesar.txt:thought to have written Julius Caesar, there were five
Caesar.txt:weeks separating the celebrations of the Catholic
Caesar.txt:Easter and the Protestant Easter. Many of the English
Caesar.txt:Protestants, like the Romans before them, felt that being
Caesar.txt:forced by Queen Elizabeth to maintain the Julian calendar was tyrannical and an interference with the true
Caesar.txt:course of nature.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ envy of his servant Lucius’ ability to sleep
Caesar.txt:soundly suggests that his mind has been recently troubled and it is worry over Caesar’s power that prevents
Caesar.txt:him from finding rest. In referring to the lean and hungry Cassius in the previous act, Caesar intimates that
Caesar.txt:men who cannot sleep at night are dangerous and now
Caesar.txt:the sleepless Brutus will indeed become a danger to
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar. In his nocturnal ruminations, Brutus has
Caesar.txt:begun to convince himself that Caesar must die.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ interior debate and the ensuing verdict that
Caesar.txt:Caesar must be assassinated illustrates some of the
Caesar.txt:major flaws in Brutus’ character. He sees himself as a
Caesar.txt:noble man with a strong sense of morality and works
Caesar.txt:hard to maintain that image with the public. In this soliloquy, however, the audience sees a man who can convince himself that murder is an appropriate answer
Caesar.txt:based solely on conjecture. Brutus merely speculates
Caesar.txt:that Caesar may become too powerful and in anticipation of what that power may do, he makes his decision
Caesar.txt:to support the actions of the conspiracy. History consistently demonstrates that power can corrupt, but if the
Caesar.txt:populace decided to eliminate all politicians based on
Caesar.txt:the possibility that they may become power-hungry,
Caesar.txt:there would be no leaders left. Brutus’ decision to join
Caesar.txt:in the plot to murder Caesar is based on fallacious logic
Caesar.txt:and shows him as a man who considers his knowledge
Caesar.txt:of human nature so great that he is capable of seeing
Caesar.txt:into the future. By assuming to play god, he can prevent
Caesar.txt:what he, in his own infinite wisdom, sees as harmful to
Caesar.txt:Rome. In this light, is Brutus any different than Caesar?
Caesar.txt:Caesar, based on his reforms in Italy, is judged harshly
Caesar.txt:for wanting Rome to conform to his worldview and here
Caesar.txt:Brutus behaves just like the man he will kill. In doing so,
Caesar.txt:he forces the world to conform to his personal vision of
Caesar.txt:it. Brutus is so concerned with his sense of self that he
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:does not recognize his irrational logic and inability to
Caesar.txt:reason; this fault will undermine the conspiracy and create havoc in the Rome he professes to love so dearly.
Caesar.txt:In addition to Brutus’ skewed logic, his susceptible
Caesar.txt:vanity and inordinate pride are also highlighted in this
Caesar.txt:scene. Lucius, finding one of the forged letters that has
Caesar.txt:been thrown into Brutus’ window, brings the note to Brutus who fails to recognize it as a forgery. Instead, he
Caesar.txt:views the note as a public affirmation of his recent decision to eliminate Caesar. His pride at being an ancestor
Caesar.txt:of the man who vanquished the Tarquin King spurs him
Caesar.txt:to fill in the blanks of the forged note with his own version of what the people want. He himself will vanquish a
Caesar.txt:King and take his place among the great heroes of Rome.
Caesar.txt:Brutus is completely aware of the hideous quality of
Caesar.txt:the conspiracy as he personifies it as a monster in lines
Caesar.txt:78–85. He may delude himself when searching his soul
Caesar.txt:for the motives for killing Caesar, but he knows without
Caesar.txt:a doubt that the act is an evil thing that should be hidden away. Brutus is nothing if not a consummate politician and he is cognizant of the fact that it is often
Caesar.txt:necessary in politics to mask a monster with “smiles
Caesar.txt:and affability.”
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s reference to Erebus in this passage
Caesar.txt:is packed with meaning and is an interesting segue into
Caesar.txt:the next section of the text. According to Greek mythology, Erebus, the dark underground passage to Hell, was
Caesar.txt:born of Chaos. Chaos was the primordial void that
Caesar.txt:existed before order was created in the universe and
Caesar.txt:from which all things, including the gods, proceeded.
Caesar.txt:Immediately following the reference, Cassius and the
Caesar.txt:other conspirators emerge from the dark, chaotic night
Caesar.txt:and take their places in the dark and chaotic history of
Caesar.txt:Rome that will follow the death of Caesar.
Caesar.txt:Cassius, always a man focused on his mission,
Caesar.txt:greets Brutus with words of flattery and the two men
Caesar.txt:move to one side, conversing in whispers while the
Caesar.txt:other conspirators take center stage. In this portion of
Caesar.txt:the scene, Shakespeare again depicts the inability of
Caesar.txt:men to tell the time of day. Not only does the writer draw
Caesar.txt:attention to the incompetence of these men to judge the
Caesar.txt:times they live in but he also shows them as an unorganized and contradictory group who cannot agree on
Caesar.txt:where the sun rises, much less on issues of vast political importance.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act II, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:69
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Brutus, as the newest official member of the conspiracy, begins his association with this group of bumbling and confused men with a few blunders of his own.
Caesar.txt:Cassius suggests that the conspirators swear an oath,
Caesar.txt:which Brutus quickly vetoes. Although Brutus knows
Caesar.txt:murder is a dishonorable act, he must find a way to
Caesar.txt:“fashion” it into something noble and virtuous and to
Caesar.txt:swear an oath, would give the conspiracy an appearance of secrecy and exclusivity. An oath would also
Caesar.txt:give way to the possibilities of lies and betrayals of that
Caesar.txt:oath, and “appearance,” important to a politician, is vital
Caesar.txt:to Brutus’ personal sense of honor to give this endeavor
Caesar.txt:the look of honesty and lofty ideals.
Caesar.txt:The next issue to be broached is the possible addition of Cicero to the list of conspirators. As revealed earlier, Cicero was an excellent and coercive speaker. He
Caesar.txt:knew the law and, as seen in contrast to Casca in the
Caesar.txt:storm scene, Cicero is calm and collected under pressure. He would be an invaluable addition to the conspiracy but again, Brutus says no. This time he cites the
Caesar.txt:excuse that Cicero “will never follow anything / That
Caesar.txt:other men begin.” Brutus is intimidated by Cicero’s tendency to be a leader rather than a follower. If Cicero
Caesar.txt:took the lead in this enterprise, who would then be
Caesar.txt:noted by history as the man who freed Rome from its
Caesar.txt:tyrant king? Cassius, in his effort to keep Brutus content
Caesar.txt:and part of the conspiracy, concedes to him again.
Caesar.txt:Decius then asks if anyone other than Caesar should
Caesar.txt:“be touched.” Cassius quickly responds that it would
Caesar.txt:benefit their plans if “Antony and Caesar fall together.”
Caesar.txt:Where Brutus is a political idealist, Cassius is a political realist. Cassius understands the workings of human
Caesar.txt:nature and is a much better judge of character than
Caesar.txt:Brutus. He knows that Antony is not only a loyal friend
Caesar.txt:to Caesar but also a fine soldier and would be in a solid
Caesar.txt:position to mount an attack against the conspiracy. Brutus, on the other hand, sees only Antony’s weaknesses:
Caesar.txt:“he is given / To sports, to wildness, and much company.” Shakespeare, again using the image of the body
Caesar.txt:politic, has Brutus compare Antony to merely a limb of
Caesar.txt:the body that will wither and die when the head, Caesar, is severed. In underestimating Antony’s strengths,
Caesar.txt:Brutus continues on the course that will doom the conspiracy to failure.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ reticence to kill Antony along with Caesar is
Caesar.txt:at first glance a noble one, but a closer look at his
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:70
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act II, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:motives reveals a clever politician attempting to do a little spin-doctoring. Just as Caesar attempted at the
Caesar.txt:beginning of the play to make the Feast of the Lupercal,
Caesar.txt:a religious ceremony, into a political one, Brutus now
Caesar.txt:desires to make a political act into something religious.
Caesar.txt:If Brutus can succeed at making an act of cold-blooded
Caesar.txt:murder done to advance the personal ambitions of a
Caesar.txt:small group of men into something that is perceived as
Caesar.txt:sacred, he will have achieved two things. Personally, he
Caesar.txt:will be able to relieve his own conscience by rationalizing an immoral act as something moral. In addition, if
Caesar.txt:the act appears as a religious sacrifice, the “common
Caesar.txt:eyes” of the people of Rome will believe that what the
Caesar.txt:conspirators have done was “necessary, and not envious.” Brutus, like every good politician, is concerned
Caesar.txt:with how his actions are interpreted by the general populace and seeks to manipulate situations to win their
Caesar.txt:approval.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Up until this point in the play, only the public Brutus
Caesar.txt:has been seen. With the entrance of his wife, Portia, the
Caesar.txt:reader has the opportunity to witness the private Brutus. He is a very different man within the confines of his
Caesar.txt:own home. He is gentle with his servant, Lucius, and
Caesar.txt:seems genuinely worried about Portia when she enters
Caesar.txt:the scene, expressing concern that she is exposing herself to the “raw cold morning.” Portia paints a portrait
Caesar.txt:of what her husband has recently become and by doing
Caesar.txt:so illustrates for the audience what the private Brutus
Caesar.txt:was before becoming involved in the plot against Caesar. Brutus shows evidence of being a man who has the
Caesar.txt:capacity to feel deeply about people and their situations
Caesar.txt:but unfortunately chooses to deny those feelings in public in an effort to maintain his honorable and stoic image.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:As the final plans are drawn for Caesar’s assassination, the clock strikes three. In the majority of editions
Caesar.txt:of Julius Caesar, the striking clock is often identified as
Caesar.txt:an anachronism. There were no mechanical clocks in
Caesar.txt:the Rome of Julius Caesar, but, as opposed to being a
Caesar.txt:mistake by the writer, the striking clock could serve as
Caesar.txt:another reminder that the time or the times they are living in are out of sync. Also, the fact that Brutus asks the
Caesar.txt:conspirators to “Count the clock” may be Shakespeare’s way of underscoring the number three as a
Caesar.txt:number identified with betrayal. The majority of Elizabethans watching the play would perhaps associate the
Caesar.txt:number three with the number of times that Peter
Caesar.txt:betrayed Jesus and also with the time, according to the
Caesar.txt:Bible, that Jesus died upon the cross.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Portia was Brutus’ first cousin as well as his second
Caesar.txt:wife. At the time the play takes place, they had been
Caesar.txt:married for about two years. She was the daughter of
Caesar.txt:Marcus Porcuis Cato or “Cato the Younger,” a leader in
Caesar.txt:Pompey’s army who fought against Caesar in Africa.
Caesar.txt:Known for his steadfast virtue and adherence to his
Caesar.txt:principles, Cato committed suicide rather than surrender to Caesar’s army. Portia herself is a strong woman,
Caesar.txt:proud of her lineage, and not afraid to confront her husband or take a stand for equality in her marriage. She
Caesar.txt:confronts Brutus, demanding to know why he is so troubled, and she does not allow him to cover his activities
Caesar.txt:with evasive stories about ill health. Appealing to Brutus’ own sense of honor, she questions if he is dishonoring her by not sharing his secrets with her. Brutus, in
Caesar.txt:one of his most sincere and heartfelt responses, replies
Caesar.txt:that she is his “true and honourable wife, / As dear to
Caesar.txt:me as are the ruddy drops / That visit my sad heart.”
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The men prepare to leave and Cassius expresses his
Caesar.txt:concern that, because Caesar has recently become
Caesar.txt:superstitious, he might choose not go to the Capitol.
Caesar.txt:Decius assures the others that he will be able to convince Caesar to go to the Capitol no matter what mood
Caesar.txt:he may be in and volunteers to escort him to the Capitol himself. Cassius insists that everyone should meet
Caesar.txt:Caesar and they all should accompany him to the Capitol. The plot is set, the hour agreed upon and Brutus bids
Caesar.txt:farewell to the conspirators with an admonishment to
Caesar.txt:conceal their purpose and, like actors, put on the mask
Caesar.txt:of normalcy.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Portia reminds Brutus of her heritage and by association hopes to convince Brutus that she is stronger than
Caesar.txt:the majority of wives. To prove her fearlessness, constancy, and equality, she shows Brutus the wound she
Caesar.txt:has made on her thigh. According to Plutarch, Portia
Caesar.txt:gashed herself with a razor. The gash became infected
Caesar.txt:and she was quite ill, running a very high fever. It might
Caesar.txt:possibly be this fever to which Brutus refers in the early
Caesar.txt:part of the scene when he comments on his wife’s weak
Caesar.txt:health. The ability to suffer silently was highly prized as
Caesar.txt:a Roman virtue and, by wounding herself, Portia seeks
Caesar.txt:to prove herself constant and worthy of Brutus’ trust.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Her husband is convinced of Portia’s trustworthiness
Caesar.txt:and promises to tell her everything as soon as possible.
Caesar.txt:The image of illness and the theme of disease runs
Caesar.txt:continuously through Julius Caesar. Caesar’s deafness,
Caesar.txt:his epilepsy, and his possible inability to produce children are revealed early in Act I. Before Cassius and the
Caesar.txt:other conspirators enter the scene in Act II, Brutus
Caesar.txt:comments on the disease that occurs between the conception of an idea and the action that completes it. He
Caesar.txt:speaks of the “genius” or soul of man being at war with
Caesar.txt:his body or “mortal instruments.” As the soul or spiritual nature of man battles with his mortal or base
Caesar.txt:desires, the state of humanity or the body politic suffers
Caesar.txt:and becomes ill. Shakespeare often compares the illness and discord in mankind to the dissonance rampant
Caesar.txt:in the universe.
Caesar.txt:The scene between Brutus and Portia incorporates
Caesar.txt:illness both real and speculative, and the entrance of
Caesar.txt:Caius Ligarius is blatant with the images of sickness in
Caesar.txt:man and in the body politic. Due to his illness, Ligarius,
Caesar.txt:a senator who had originally supported Pompey but had,
Caesar.txt:like the other conspirators, been pardoned by Caesar,
Caesar.txt:comes late to the meeting. He tells Brutus that his illness will be cured if Brutus is involved in an “exploit
Caesar.txt:worthy the name of honor.” According to Brutus, this
Caesar.txt:honorable exploit is, “A piece of work that will make
Caesar.txt:sick men whole.” Caius replies, “But are not some
Caesar.txt:whole that we must make sick?” Disease is running
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act II, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:71
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:rampant through both individuals and Rome. Caesar, the
Caesar.txt:head of Rome, is suffering from overly ambitious desires
Caesar.txt:for power. His illness has infected the rest of the body,
Caesar.txt:or the people of Rome. Brutus cannot sleep at night and
Caesar.txt:his wife fears he is ill. Portia is running a high fever from
Caesar.txt:the wound she has inflicted on herself. Ligarius’ health
Caesar.txt:affects the conspiracy. There is no choice but to find a
Caesar.txt:cure for the illness before it kills the entire body. Unfortunately, Brutus and Cassius do not effect a cure.
Caesar.txt:Rather, they choose to cut off the head of the body (Caesar) in an effort to heal the body as a whole, but a body
Caesar.txt:cannot live without a head, and Rome will not be cured
Caesar.txt:of its ills in this way either. The body, either human or
Caesar.txt:politic, must have a head. Without it, the body dies.
Caesar.txt:Brutus and Cassius have made plans to cut out the
Caesar.txt:disease they have diagnosed as fatal to Rome, but their
Caesar.txt:scheme seems to stop there. No discussion has ensued
Caesar.txt:concerning what will happen after Caesar is dead. Who
Caesar.txt:will rule Rome? Will this new regime govern the people
Caesar.txt:in new ways? The conspirators are lethally shortsighted and their lack of a plan of action spells disaster
Caesar.txt:for their cause, whatever that may be.
Caesar.txt:Caius Ligarius, in the final few lines of this scene,
Caesar.txt:calls Brutus the “Soul of Rome.” If Brutus is indeed a
Caesar.txt:shining example of the conscience and spiritual nature
Caesar.txt:of Rome, it is no wonder that chaos and disorder are tormenting the capitol of Italy.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:S
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:cene two shifts from the home of Brutus to Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:house in the early morning of the Ides of March.
Caesar.txt:The storm of the previous scene continues to rage. Just
Caesar.txt:as the private side of Brutus was exposed in the last
Caesar.txt:scene, here Shakespeare shows us the private side of
Caesar.txt:Caesar. By showing in consecutive scenes, both men in
Caesar.txt:their homes, in conversations with their wives, Shakespeare highlights the parallel lives of the two men. Both
Caesar.txt:men have had sleepless nights; both have wives concerned with their well being; and, as the play progresses, Brutus will become more and more like the
Caesar.txt:man he seeks to destroy.
Caesar.txt:The foreshadowing of Caesar’s imminent death
Caesar.txt:begins early on in this scene as Caesar comments on
Caesar.txt:Caesar instructs his servant to have the priests sacrifice an animal for the purpose of determining the future.
Caesar.txt:claim that he has become quite superstitious lately.
Caesar.txt:Alone, the private Caesar is a fearful man concerned
Caesar.txt:with what the signs point to as an ominous future.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:The Capitoline and the Forum.
Caesar.txt:Gianni Tortoli/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:person. Even with his wife and in the privacy of his own
Caesar.txt:chambers, Caesar is unwilling to cast off his god-like
Caesar.txt:demeanor. If there had been a humble Caesar before
Caesar.txt:this time, he is gone now, and in his place is a man who
Caesar.txt:what she has heard of the strange events of the previous night. She speaks of lions giving birth in the streets
Caesar.txt:and graves that have opened and “yielded up their
Caesar.txt:dead.” She tells of blood dripping upon the capitol and
Caesar.txt:comets blazing through the heavens and Caesar discounts every single omen. (The sighting of a comet had
Caesar.txt:always held the connotation of the death of a monarch.)
Caesar.txt:In July (the month of Caesar’s birth) of 44 B.C., four
Caesar.txt:months after Caesar’s death, a comet, so bright that it
Caesar.txt:could be seen during the day, was observed for seven
Caesar.txt:days in the skies above Rome. Octavius Caesar used
Caesar.txt:the phenomena to encourage the myth of Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:deification.
Caesar.txt:When the servant appears, he informs Caesar that
Caesar.txt:the priests insist that Caesar stay home today because
Caesar.txt:there was no heart found in the morning’s sacrifice, and
Caesar.txt:still Caesar refuses to be swayed. Caesar is purposely
Caesar.txt:tempting the Fates by denying every sign they have
Caesar.txt:sent to him to prevent his
Caesar.txt:death. He seems to recognize the hand Fate plays in
Caesar.txt:the lives of ordinary men
Caesar.txt:but pompously ignores it in
Caesar.txt:reference to himself:
Caesar.txt:“these predictions / Are to
Caesar.txt:the world in general as to

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Decius makes his entrance.
Caesar.txt:His plan (to make sure that
Caesar.txt:Caesar goes to the capitol)
Caesar.txt:is in immediate danger of
Caesar.txt:being thwarted. Decius
Caesar.txt:wants to know why Caesar
Caesar.txt:is not planning to go to the
Caesar.txt:Capitol, and Caesar relates
Caesar.txt:Decius, as promised, is a
Caesar.txt:master of manipulation,
Caesar.txt:and he begins to work his
Caesar.txt:sorcery on Caesar by
Caesar.txt:appealing to his vanity. He
Caesar.txt:tells Caesar that “This
Caesar.txt:dream is all amiss interpreted,” and, with those
Caesar.txt:few words, Decius articulates one of the major
Caesar.txt:themes present in Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar, the manipulation of
Caesar.txt:both fact and fallacy to
Caesar.txt:achieve one’s own end.
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar and the Conspirators.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:So much in this play is Mary Evans Picture Library
Caesar.txt:misinterpreted by so many,
Caesar.txt:and the distortions are often a result of the characters’
Caesar.txt:ego-driven desire to be proven right. The conspirators
Caesar.txt:misconstrue the feelings of the common people towards
Caesar.txt:Caesar. Casca, Cassius, and Caesar all confuse the
Caesar.txt:signs and omens of the storm. Brutus continually misinterprets people and situations, and Cassius will die
Caesar.txt:when he misinterprets a message at the end of the play.
Caesar.txt:In this particular instance, Decius, appealing to Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:ominous into something fortuitous. Instead of interpreting Caesar’s blood pouring from the statue as a sign of
Caesar.txt:his impending death, Decius declares that the blood is
Caesar.txt:a sign that Caesar provides the nourishment that will
Caesar.txt:heal Rome and its people. In a clever display of flattery,
Caesar.txt:Decius imposes religious connotations on the dream,
Caesar.txt:suggesting that the people of Rome, rather than rejoicing in Caesar’s spilt blood, are actually searching for
Caesar.txt:“tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.” The reference to religious icons places Caesar in the shadow of
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:sainthood, referring to the belief that handkerchiefs
Caesar.txt:dipped in the blood of martyrs had healing properties.
Caesar.txt:dream, Decius foreshadows Caesar’s eventual martyrdom and rise to virtual sainthood in his ironic interpretation of the dream’s symbolism.
Caesar.txt:Not wanting to risk the chance that Caesar may still
Caesar.txt:refuse to go to the Capitol, Decius reminds him that the
Caesar.txt:Senate is planning to give him a crown that day. He also
Caesar.txt:warns Caesar that the Senators might possibly ridicule
Caesar.txt:him if he stays home because his wife has had a bad
Caesar.txt:dream. Caesar is swayed and, just as he agrees to leave
Caesar.txt:for the Capitol, the other conspirators enter the scene.
Caesar.txt:Interestingly, Cassius is conspicuously missing from
Caesar.txt:the list of conspirators named in the stage directions.
Caesar.txt:Considering his insistence in the previous scene that
Caesar.txt:“we will all of us be there to fetch him,” it seems most
Caesar.txt:strange that Cassius would not be among his co-conspirators at such a crucial moment. Perhaps Cassius is
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:aware that Caesar does not trust him and so he makes
Caesar.txt:the decision to stay away in order to not arouse Caesar’s suspicion. After close examination of the play, textual scholars such as Fredson Bowers suggest that the
Caesar.txt:parts of Cassius and Ligarius were played by the same
Caesar.txt:actor. In scenes where Cassius appears, Ligarius is not
Caesar.txt:on stage, and when Ligarius is seen, Cassius is missing.
Caesar.txt:In this scene, Ligarius is listed as present in the stage
Caesar.txt:directions and Publius, a character unknown up to this
Caesar.txt:point has the honor of speaking first to Caesar.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act II, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:79
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar affably welcomes the conspirators into his
Caesar.txt:home and invites them to share wine with him. Again,
Caesar.txt:the biblical reference to the Last Supper is obvious as
Caesar.txt:Caesar shares wine with the men who will betray him.
Caesar.txt:The scene also, once again, establishes parallels
Caesar.txt:between Caesar and Brutus. In addition to the aspects
Caesar.txt:already pointed out, both men are gracious hosts; they
Caesar.txt:both are swayed easily by flattery and fatally trust the
Caesar.txt:words and friendship of the conspirators.

Caesar.txt:ccording to Plutarch, Artemidorus, a professor of
Caesar.txt:rhetoric, taught, and thereby associated with, many

Caesar.txt:has put his information into a letter that he intends to
Caesar.txt:pass to Caesar as he approaches the Capitol. His
Caesar.txt:attempt to save Caesar illustrates that Caesar has supporters as well as enemies, and, for the first time in the
Caesar.txt:play, the conspirators are referred to as “traitorous.”
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:This short scene, allowing for the passage of time
Caesar.txt:between Caesar’s leaving home and arrival at the capitol, also serves to create dramatic tension. Even though

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:S
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:hakespeare continues to build the suspense that
Caesar.txt:will lead up to Caesar’s assassination. Waiting is a
Caesar.txt:suspenseful activity, and Act II has been a continuous
Caesar.txt:round of waiting: waiting out the storm, waiting for the
Caesar.txt:conspirators to arrive, waiting for the dawn, waiting to
Caesar.txt:go to the Senate, and now, Portia waits to hear news
Caesar.txt:from the capitol. In this scene, Portia’s frantic behavior
Caesar.txt:leads the audience to believe that Brutus has indeed
Caesar.txt:kept his promise to reveal all of his secrets to his wife.
Caesar.txt:Portia commands Lucius to run to the Senate House, but
Caesar.txt:she forgets to tell him why he is to go. In his confusion,
Caesar.txt:Lucius does not leave and Portia seems almost surprised to see him still standing there. She quickly makes
Caesar.txt:up a story concerning her worry about Brutus’ health.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Senate House. Having been with Caesar when he was
Caesar.txt:originally warned by the soothsayer to “Beware the
Caesar.txt:Ides of March,” Portia must be struck by the significance of the earlier warning. Her anxiety grows
Caesar.txt:because of what she knows will happen in the Capitol
Caesar.txt:in a very short time. She questions the soothsayer, asking him where he has been and what time it is. Portia
Caesar.txt:then asks the question most pressing in her mind: “Is
Caesar.txt:Caesar gone to the Capitol?” The soothsayer assures
Caesar.txt:Portia that he is not there yet and verifies Portia’s intimation that he has a suit for Caesar. The soothsayer
Caesar.txt:repeats his apprehension that something will happen
Caesar.txt:today to Caesar and expresses his desire to speak to
Caesar.txt:Caesar about his fears as he passes through the streets.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Using personification, a figure of speech where
Caesar.txt:something not human is given human qualities, Portia
Caesar.txt:calls upon constancy to give her strength and “Set a
Caesar.txt:huge mountain ‘tween my heart and tongue!” Having
Caesar.txt:once pleaded to be made privy to the conspiracy, Portia is now burdened by Brutus’ secrets. Fearing that she
Caesar.txt:will betray her husband, Portia laments that despite her
Caesar.txt:masculine mind she has only a woman’s strength.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Portia, feeling faint and overcome by the emotional
Caesar.txt:turmoil of the day, blames her woman’s heart for her
Caesar.txt:weakness. She offers a prayer for the success of her
Caesar.txt:husband’s enterprise and exits the scene. This is the last
Caesar.txt:time Portia is seen on the stage, but it becomes evident
Caesar.txt:later in the play that, like Caesar, she becomes an innocent victim of her husband’s actions.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Portia’s hysteria makes her imagine that she hears
Caesar.txt:noises coming from the capitol and she is surprised and
Caesar.txt:concerned to see the Soothsayer making his way to the

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:On the way to the Capitol, Caesar encounters the soothsayer. Caesar
Caesar.txt:again ignores his warnings and when Artemidorus tries to give his letter
Caesar.txt:to Caesar, Caesar refuses to read it until later. Cassius is nervous that the
Caesar.txt:plot has been discovered but all progresses as planned. Inside the
Caesar.txt:Senate, Metellus Cimber approaches Caesar to ask for enfranchisement
Caesar.txt:for his banished brother. All the other conspirators approach Caesar one
Caesar.txt:by one supposedly on behalf of Cimber’s brother. Brutus is the last to
Caesar.txt:approach. Caesar refuses to change his mind, claiming he is as constant
Caesar.txt:as the Northern star. As planned, Casca is the first to stab Caesar. The
Caesar.txt:other conspirators follow suit but Caesar refuses to die until Brutus
Caesar.txt:renders the final cut. Caesar falls dead at the base of Pompey’s statue and
Caesar.txt:the senators, thrown into a state of confusion, run panicked into the
Caesar.txt:streets. Antony sends his servant to ask permission for him to return to
Caesar.txt:the Senate to hear the reasons for Caesar’s murder. When he arrives,
Caesar.txt:Antony pretends to befriend the conspirators, shaking their bloody hands.
Caesar.txt:He asks permission to speak at Caesar’s funeral and Brutus, against
Caesar.txt:Cassius’ wishes, gives him his consent. The conspirators leave to explain
Caesar.txt:to the people why they killed Caesar, leaving Antony alone with Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:mutilated body. Antony’s deep grief becomes apparent as he vows to
Caesar.txt:revenge Caesar’s murder. A servant arrives, informing Antony that
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s nephew, Octavius, is on his way to Rome.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he dramatic tension grows as Caesar’s inevitable
Caesar.txt:march toward death progresses. He enters the
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:stage followed by the conspirators and is intercepted
Caesar.txt:by both the Soothsayer and Artemidorus. In a display
Caesar.txt:seemingly designed to impress his public, Caesar
Caesar.txt:haughtily dismisses the Soothsayer and, with a show of
Caesar.txt:false modesty, refuses to read Artemidorus’ note until
Caesar.txt:later: “What touches us ourself shall be last served.” By
Caesar.txt:refusing to acknowledge the omens present in the previous evening’s storm, the missing heart in the auguers
Caesar.txt:and Artemidorus’ note, it becomes obvious that Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:arrogance has triumphed over his wisdom. Any sympathy that the reader might have felt for his plight is now
Caesar.txt:almost non-existent.
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s earlier perception that Cassius is a great
Caesar.txt:observer who sees through the deeds of men is especially significant in this scene. With a heightened sense
Caesar.txt:of apprehension brought about by the fear of being
Caesar.txt:caught, Cassius notices Artemidorus trying to pass his
Caesar.txt:scroll to Caesar and, along with Publius, urges him to
Caesar.txt:move on to the Capitol. He is then approached by Popilius who expresses his wish that “your enterprise to-day
Caesar.txt:may thrive.” Cassius feigns ignorance and pretends not
Caesar.txt:to know what Popilius is speaking about, but his fear
Caesar.txt:grows as he watches Popilius move toward Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:side. With the very real possibility of disclosure, Cassius
Caesar.txt:swears to Brutus that if their plot is discovered he will
Caesar.txt:kill himself rather than be arrested for treason.
Caesar.txt:Suicide, to a predominately Christian, Elizabethan
Caesar.txt:audience, would take on a much different connotation
Caesar.txt:than it had in ancient Rome. To Shakespeare’s audience,
Caesar.txt:and indeed to many readers even today, suicide is considered a mortal sin; an act against God and nature. In
Caesar.txt:Elizabethan England, it was also an act against the government. A suspected victim of suicide would not be
Caesar.txt:allowed to receive the final sacraments or be buried in
Caesar.txt:sacred ground. Often, victims of suicide were buried at
Caesar.txt:the center of a crossroads, because their spirits,
Caesar.txt:thought to be unable to go to heaven, would wander the
Caesar.txt:world. Many Elizabethans believed that if the body of a
Caesar.txt:suicide victim was buried at a crossroads, the ghost of
Caesar.txt:the victim would not know which direction to follow. All
Caesar.txt:money and property belonging to the suicide victims
Caesar.txt:would be confiscated by the state, leaving the surviving
Caesar.txt:family humiliated and destitute.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:From the Roman perspective, however, suicide was
Caesar.txt:considered an act of heroism if it was done in an effort
Caesar.txt:to avoid living a life that conflicted with the moral and
Caesar.txt:ethical values held in esteem by the person committing
Caesar.txt:the act. For Cassius, living under the tyranny of Caesar
Caesar.txt:was unthinkable. Thus, death would become his only
Caesar.txt:alternative. For many members of Shakespeare’s original audience, Cassius’ desire to die rather than be
Caesar.txt:arrested for treason was an emotion they could identify
Caesar.txt:with. The severed heads of men and women accused
Caesar.txt:of treason against the Crown, more often than not,
Caesar.txt:adorned the spikes along the castle walls in London.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s plays were written specifically for
Caesar.txt:performance, and his stage directions are often indicated within the text rather than added to the script.
Caesar.txt:Lines 25–26 represent an example of what is known as
Caesar.txt:an implied stage direction. Cassius points out to Brutus
Caesar.txt:that Trebonius has set into motion the next stage of the
Caesar.txt:plot against Caesar: “Trebonius knows his time, for look
Caesar.txt:you, Brutus, / He draws Mark Antony out of the way.”
Caesar.txt:This would indicate to an actor that he must engage
Caesar.txt:Mark Antony in some way that would “draw” him from
Caesar.txt:the stage.
Caesar.txt:With Mark Antony out of the way, Decius comes forward to put the last moves of the conspiracy into place.
Caesar.txt:Metellus Cimber is to approach Caesar first to ask for
Caesar.txt:pardon for his banished brother. Each conspirator in
Caesar.txt:turn will then join with Cimber until Caesar is surrounded and Casca is assigned the job of being the first
Caesar.txt:to stab Caesar. Caesar takes his place and prepares to
Caesar.txt:address the business of the day.
Caesar.txt:As planned, Metellus Cimber approaches Caesar
Caesar.txt:and asks for the reinstatement of his brother as a
Caesar.txt:Roman Citizen. Caesar’s arrogance reaches astounding
Caesar.txt:proportions as he refuses Cimber’s plea based on his
Caesar.txt:distaste for flattery and his power to remain constant.
Caesar.txt:Ironically, Caesar’s tendency to be swayed by flattery
Caesar.txt:was just witnessed in the preceding scene and his constancy is ambiguous at best. For example, he has just
Caesar.txt:spent much of the previous scene vacillating between
Caesar.txt:staying home or going to the capitol and faltering from
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare is a master at showing both sides of an
Caesar.txt:issue or a character, and it is possible to interpret Caesar’s recent actions in other ways. The qualities that
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:100
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act III, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:comprise a great leader is a major theme in Julius Caesar, and an issue that is often and hotly debated. Even
Caesar.txt:though Caesar’s arrogance seems to be the motivating
Caesar.txt:factor in much that he does, it is also possible to look at
Caesar.txt:his choices in another manner. With regards to Artemidorus’ letter for example, Caesar refuses to look at it
Caesar.txt:until later, because the matter within the letter is personal to Caesar. Possibly, this choice illustrates Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:propensity to put the issues of the people above his own
Caesar.txt:concerns. Constancy is also an important quality in an
Caesar.txt:effective leader. It is unjust to have one set of rules for
Caesar.txt:friends and another set for everyone else. In his “Northern Star” speech, Caesar is maintaining a firm position
Caesar.txt:based on the laws of Rome and the judgment passed on
Caesar.txt:Metellus Cimber’s brother by the ruling factions in the
Caesar.txt:government. Mercy and compassion must figure into
Caesar.txt:the laws of the land but is it not the leader’s responsibility to maintain those laws as set down without displaying favoritism?
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s choices can be argued to be either arrogant
Caesar.txt:or admirable but it is his growing sense of his own deification that destroys the man. By comparing himself to
Caesar.txt:Olympus, a mountain in Greece presumed to be the
Caesar.txt:home of the gods, Caesar is publicly declaring a godlike presence within himself. However, instead of showing god-like mercy and compassion by pardoning
Caesar.txt:Cimber’s brother, Caesar chooses to exhibit the very
Caesar.txt:human quality of fundamental stubbornness. By the time
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar is assassinated in the Senate by Brutus and his companions.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Casca raises his hand against Caesar, it is almost a
Caesar.txt:relief to the reader to bring an end to Caesar’s egotistical hubris.
Caesar.txt:Despite Brutus’ earlier instructions that Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:death should be as clean as possible, each conspirator
Caesar.txt:takes his turn at Caesar. Having endured twenty-two
Caesar.txt:stab wounds, the still standing Caesar, his lacerations
Caesar.txt:inflicted by Brutus, the man he loved and perhaps
Caesar.txt:fathered, that causes Caesar’s life force to vanish, and
Caesar.txt:he falls dead to the floor. The sympathy of the audience
Caesar.txt:immediately swings back to Caesar as the pathos of his
Caesar.txt:last words — “Et tu, Brute? — Then fall Caesar” —
Caesar.txt:echoes through the stunned and silent Senate.
Caesar.txt:Cinna breaks the eerie silence with his cries of “Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!” Chaos ensues and all
Caesar.txt:but one senator run into the streets proclaiming the
Caesar.txt:news of Caesar’s assassination. In a brilliant stroke that
Caesar.txt:in the middle of this carnage adds a decidedly compassionate edge to both Brutus and Cassius, Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:leaves one aging senator alone on the stage with the
Caesar.txt:conspirators. Brutus assures the frightened old man
Caesar.txt:that he will not be harmed and Cassius worries that
Caesar.txt:Publius might be hurt in the madness and suggests that
Caesar.txt:he leave right away.
Caesar.txt:According to Plutarch, each member of the conspiracy, in order to be equally
Caesar.txt:involved in the murder, had
Caesar.txt:agreed to stab Caesar at
Caesar.txt:least once. With twentythree stab wounds, Caesar’s body resembled more
Caesar.txt:the hacked carcass than
Caesar.txt:the sacrificial “dish for the
Caesar.txt:gods” that Brutus had
Caesar.txt:aspired to. Bladders or
Caesar.txt:sponges full of animal blood
Caesar.txt:were concealed under costumes and when Caesar
Caesar.txt:was stabbed, the actor
Caesar.txt:playing Caesar would be
Caesar.txt:saturated in the blood. This
Caesar.txt:sight, along with the very
Caesar.txt:real and pungent smell of
Caesar.txt:animal blood that would
Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:permeate the Elizabethan theatre, certainly made the semblance of the conspirators as
Caesar.txt:butchers a very powerful and

Caesar.txt:and hands as well as the weapons of the murderers. As
Caesar.txt:with almost every image in the play, this one can be
Caesar.txt:interpreted in numerous ways. If the murder of Caesar
Caesar.txt:was a barbaric deed done to further the personal agendas of greedy, jealous men, then the blood on the hands
Caesar.txt:of the conspirators is a sign of guilt. If, however, the
Caesar.txt:murder is a sacrificial purging of the sickness that runs
Caesar.txt:through the body politic of Rome, then the blood
Caesar.txt:becomes a symbol of catharsis and purification.
Caesar.txt:Throughout the play, Brutus’ poor political judgment
Caesar.txt:has laid the foundation for the failure of the conspiracy.
Caesar.txt:In this scene, the reader is also made privy to Brutus’
Caesar.txt:naivete. Not only does Brutus convince himself that
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s murder was a sacrifice, making heroes of the
Caesar.txt:conspirators, but he justifies the act as beneficial,
Caesar.txt:rationalizing it by believing that he has actually saved
Caesar.txt:Caesar from the terrible fate of having to spend too
Caesar.txt:many years fearing death.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In the highly charged elation
Caesar.txt:of the moments following Caesar’s death, Shakespeare uses a
Caesar.txt:dramatic construct that has
Caesar.txt:come to be known as
Caesar.txt:metadrama or metatheatre.
Caesar.txt:Throughout many of his plays,
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare makes reference
Caesar.txt:to his belief that “All the world’s
Caesar.txt:a stage, / And all the men and
Caesar.txt:women merely players” and he
Caesar.txt:frequently uses the convention
Caesar.txt:of the play-within-the-play in
Caesar.txt:such works as A Midsummer’s
Caesar.txt:Night Dream and Hamlet.
Caesar.txt:Metadrama is much like a picture of a mirror that must reflect
Caesar.txt:itself into infinity. Which is the
Caesar.txt:real image and which is just a
Caesar.txt:mere reflection? The reader is
Caesar.txt:jolted from the suspension of disbelief into a very different dimension of theatricality, one that
Caesar.txt:highlights the capricious and
Caesar.txt:illusory nature of the theatre.
Caesar.txt:Brutus and Cassius, casting
Caesar.txt:themselves as the leading players in this “lofty scene,” can believe themselves to be
Caesar.txt:heroes and, in a very real sense, by hiding behind the
Caesar.txt:metaphorical mask of actors, absolve themselves from
Caesar.txt:their horrendous deed.
Caesar.txt:Cassius’ question, “How many ages hence / Shall
Caesar.txt:this our lofty scene be acted over / In states unborn and
Caesar.txt:accents yet unknown!” is prophetic in many ways.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s play has been performed consistently for
Caesar.txt:the almost 400 years since his death and in languages
Caesar.txt:unheard and in countries undiscovered at the time the
Caesar.txt:play was written. To modern readers it takes on an even
Caesar.txt:deeper meaning, because history has continued to
Caesar.txt:repeat itself with the assassinations of great leaders
Caesar.txt:such as Ghandi, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King,
Caesar.txt:Jr. As long as men have power, there will be other men
Caesar.txt:who will kill to gain it.
Caesar.txt:As the conspirators are preparing to leave the Capitol to explain their deeds to the masses, a servant sent
Caesar.txt:by Mark Antony detains them. Up to this point in the
Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act III, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:play, Antony has been a minor character, one who
Caesar.txt:raised more contempt than concern. Only Cassius
Caesar.txt:thought of him as a possible threat. The frivolous Mark
Caesar.txt:Antony seen in the earlier scenes of the play now transforms himself into a shrewd, clever, and astute
Caesar.txt:politician.
Caesar.txt:Antony is aware enough to know that if anyone other
Caesar.txt:than Caesar is to die, it will be him. So Antony sends his
Caesar.txt:servant to the conspirators with a well-prepared speech
Caesar.txt:to make sure it is safe to approach. The message, as
Caesar.txt:related by the servant, foreshadows Antony’s ability to
Caesar.txt:manipulate both people and situations with his words.
Caesar.txt:The first line of the message appeals to Brutus’ vanity,
Caesar.txt:calling him, “noble, wise, valiant, and honest.” Cassius
Caesar.txt:voices his misgivings but Brutus overrules him and
Caesar.txt:allows Antony to enter the Capitol for an explanation of
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s murder.
Caesar.txt:Antony is shocked and dismayed to see the ravaged
Caesar.txt:body of Caesar, but he knows he must bide his time and
Caesar.txt:make friends with the conspirators if he is to avenge
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s death. Antony continues the running metaphor of
Caesar.txt:both disease and blood when he
Caesar.txt:asks, “Who else must be let
Caesar.txt:blood, who else is rank.” If the
Caesar.txt:body politic is swollen with disease, then the blood of Antony
Caesar.txt:may be required to purge the
Caesar.txt:state, restoring it to health. Brutus assures him that the conspirators have no desire to harm him
Caesar.txt:in any way. Cassius, with his
Caesar.txt:usual political acuity, cuts
Caesar.txt:through Brutus’ offer of love and
Caesar.txt:reverence to offer Antony the
Caesar.txt:more practical and desirable
Caesar.txt:proposal: a share of the power
Caesar.txt:and perks in the new government.
Caesar.txt:Antony does not answer Cassius’ offers but proceeds, in a
Caesar.txt:show of friendship and respect,
Caesar.txt:to shake the bloody hand of each
Caesar.txt:of the conspirators. With Caesar’s blood on his own hands,
Caesar.txt:Antony evokes Caesar’s spirit for
Caesar.txt:the first time. Caesar’s spirit will
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar dead.
Caesar.txt:Mary Evans Picture Library
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:pervade the remainder of the play, and, though his body
Caesar.txt:is dead, his influence lives on. Again, Cassius interrupts
Caesar.txt:Antony and insists upon knowing whether Antony is to
Caesar.txt:be counted as a friend of the conspiracy. Antony gives
Caesar.txt:an evasive answer and quickly changes the subject,
Caesar.txt:asking for permission to speak at a funeral for Caesar.
Caesar.txt:Brutus agrees immediately, but Cassius, having noticed
Caesar.txt:Antony’s evasive answers when questioned about his
Caesar.txt:loyalty to the conspiracy, takes Brutus aside and cautions him not to make the mistake of allowing Antony to
Caesar.txt:speak at the funeral. Brutus refuses to listen to Cassius’
Caesar.txt:fears and proceeds to turn Caesar’s body over to Antony
Caesar.txt:with a set of instructions for his funeral speech.
Caesar.txt:It was not uncommon for the body of a man who had
Caesar.txt:transgressed against the state to be left unburied in the
Caesar.txt:City Square. The family would be dishonored by having
Caesar.txt:to watch the unconsecrated body of their loved one
Caesar.txt:eaten by dogs and picked at by birds. The conspirators,
Caesar.txt:seeing Caesar as an enemy of the state, would have
Caesar.txt:been justified in leaving Caesar’s body in the square, so
Caesar.txt:their agreement to allow him a proper burial was a generous concession. Brutus
Caesar.txt:instructs Antony to “prepare” or
Caesar.txt:clean Caesar’s body, and wrap it
Caesar.txt:in a fresh shroud before following them to the pulpit where
Caesar.txt:Brutus plans to speak.
Caesar.txt:Left alone, Antony finally
Caesar.txt:reveals his true feelings toward
Caesar.txt:the men he calls “butchers.” Calling on the gods, Antony curses
Caesar.txt:both the conspirators and Rome.
Caesar.txt:Using images that are both
Caesar.txt:bloody and brutal, Antony invokes
Caesar.txt:the spirit of Caesar and vows to
Caesar.txt:revenge Caesar’s murder by
Caesar.txt:unleashing the most devastating
Caesar.txt:and destructive forces of hell. As
Caesar.txt:though his prayers are immediately answered, a servant enters
Caesar.txt:with the news that Octavius Caesar, Julius’ grandnephew, his only
Caesar.txt:living relative and heir, is within 21
Caesar.txt:miles of Rome. Julius may be
Caesar.txt:dead but another Caesar moves
Caesar.txt:in quickly to assume his role and
Caesar.txt:take his place.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:istorically, Julius Caesar’s funeral took place
Caesar.txt:H
Caesar.txt:on March 20, five days after
Caesar.txt:his assassination. However,
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare has taken
Caesar.txt:dramatic license and compressed approximately six
Caesar.txt:weeks of events into a single scene that takes place
Caesar.txt:in the Forum. During the five
Caesar.txt:days between Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:death and his funeral, the
Caesar.txt:actual conspirators were
Caesar.txt:quick to place themselves
Caesar.txt:into positions of powers,
Caesar.txt:assigning
Caesar.txt:themselves
Caesar.txt:heads of provinces such as
Caesar.txt:Macedonia, Syria, and Asia
Caesar.txt:Minor.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s version
Caesar.txt:of the story has the conspirators going directly to
Caesar.txt:the Forum to explain to the
Caesar.txt:angry crowd why they felt
Caesar.txt:it necessary to eliminate
Caesar.txt:Caesar. This scene is one
Caesar.txt:of the most brilliant examples in dramatic literature
Caesar.txt:of the power of words to
Caesar.txt:manipulate both intellect
Caesar.txt:and emotion. As planned,
Caesar.txt:Brutus is the first to speak.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s Forum.
Caesar.txt:Ronald Sheridan/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ speech is written in simple, balanced prose,
Caesar.txt:a much more logical and straightforward style than that
Caesar.txt:of poetry. He begins by reminding the people that he is
Caesar.txt:an honorable man and assumes the crowd will make the
Caesar.txt:connection between an honorable man and an honorably motivated deed. Shakespeare creates rhythm in
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ speech through the use of parallelism (the repetition of words, phrases or sentences that have the
Caesar.txt:same grammatical structure). This rhetorical tool is used
Caesar.txt:to reinforce an idea or concept by making it memorable
Caesar.txt:to an audience, but Brutus weakens his case by relying
Caesar.txt:on merely technical tools to make his suit to the crowd.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ speech is void of passion, appealing to the
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:crowd’s sense of reason and mistakenly deeming them
Caesar.txt:his intellectual equals. His questions to the crowd are
Caesar.txt:rhetorical in nature; thus, no answer is really expected.
Caesar.txt:Politicians and other orators often use rhetorical questioning to manipulate an audience into believing they
Caesar.txt:have made up their own minds about an issue when it
Caesar.txt:has actually already been decided for them. Rather than
Caesar.txt:aiming to reach the mob’s emotions on a personal level,
Caesar.txt:Brutus appeals to the abstract ideal of patriotism and
Caesar.txt:offers to sacrifice himself for Rome. The bottom line,
Caesar.txt:however, is that there is only one explanation offered to
Caesar.txt:justify the need for Caesar’s assassination: He was
Caesar.txt:ambitious. Brutus makes no attempt to explain in what
Caesar.txt:ways Caesar was ambitious but expects the crowd to
Caesar.txt:take him at his word because he is an honorable man.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act III, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Again, Brutus demonstrates his almost absurd inability to read people and situations. He wants to believe
Caesar.txt:that the common people of Rome are all noble, moral
Caesar.txt:people with an unquestioning sense of patriotism but,
Caesar.txt:as seen in the opening scene of the play, that is not the
Caesar.txt:case. The commoners are often coarse, easily manipulated, and more interested in personal pleasures than
Caesar.txt:public politics. It is obvious that the crowd does not
Caesar.txt:grasp the reasoning behind the actions of the conspirators when they offer to crown Brutus, erect statues of
Caesar.txt:him, and declare, “Let him be Caesar.” Ironically, the
Caesar.txt:crowd seeks to replace Caesar with the man who killed
Caesar.txt:him; to create a new dictator from the one who
Caesar.txt:attempted to eliminate the previous one. Brutus, however, chooses to ignore the callings and, feeling he has
Caesar.txt:sufficiently convinced the crowd that the action of the
Caesar.txt:conspirators was necessary, confidently but naively,
Caesar.txt:leaves the pulpit to Antony. His trust in Antony is as misplaced as his trust in the mob before him.
Caesar.txt:The exact climax of Julius Caesar has been debated
Caesar.txt:for years. Some feel that the actual murder of Caesar is
Caesar.txt:the climax, whereas others contend that the turning
Caesar.txt:point occurs when Antony turns the crowd against the
Caesar.txt:conspirators. Obviously, the death of Caesar is a
Caesar.txt:moment of emotional intensity that could qualify as the
Caesar.txt:defining moment of the play, but the instant of greatest
Caesar.txt:intensity and suspense occurs when Antony stirs the
Caesar.txt:crowd to such frenzy that
Caesar.txt:the downfall of the conspirators becomes inevitable.
Caesar.txt:Antony claims not to be
Caesar.txt:a great orator, but his
Caesar.txt:funeral speech is three
Caesar.txt:times longer than the one
Caesar.txt:given by Brutus and will,
Caesar.txt:with its more emotionally
Caesar.txt:effective use of poetry,
Caesar.txt:move the people of Rome
Caesar.txt:to violent acts of rage. As
Caesar.txt:he begins to speak, Antony
Caesar.txt:has the difficult task of
Caesar.txt:commanding the attention
Caesar.txt:of a crowd set against his
Caesar.txt:purpose. He does this by
Caesar.txt:first addressing them as
Caesar.txt:friends and assuring them
Caesar.txt:that his only intention is to
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:113
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:bury Caesar. It is obvious from the next line of the
Caesar.txt:speech that Antony has listened carefully to Brutus’
Caesar.txt:speech and found the explanation of Caesar’s ambition
Caesar.txt:to be a weak one. He picks up on the word, and repeating it consistently, begins to prove the contrary. He also,
Caesar.txt:in keeping with the instructions Brutus has given him,
Caesar.txt:reminds the crowd that Brutus is an honorable man. By
Caesar.txt:alternating ironic references to Brutus’ honor and nobility with real evidence of Caesar’s lack of ambition,
Caesar.txt:Antony forces the crowd to understand the subtext of
Caesar.txt:his words without violating the conspirators’ instructions not to speak ill of them. Without violating the rules
Caesar.txt:established by Brutus, Antony destroys Brutus’ only
Caesar.txt:argument, that Caesar was ambitious.
Caesar.txt:Unlike Brutus’ speech, which seemed almost sterile,
Caesar.txt:planned, and memorized, Antony’s speech suggests a
Caesar.txt:more spontaneous approach, with attention being paid
Caesar.txt:to the effect his words are having on his audience.
Caesar.txt:When he suspects that he has completely undermined
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ singular argument that Caesar was ambitious,
Caesar.txt:Antony begins to weep openly for his fallen friend. A
Caesar.txt:man held in such high regard moves the crowd to
Caesar.txt:silence and sympathy at this public display of emotion.
Caesar.txt:Although Antony’s tears may have been shed to purposely sway the crowd to his purposes, his grief over
Caesar.txt:the loss of Caesar appears genuine and his feelings fuel
Caesar.txt:the speech and thus, enflame the crowd.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act III, Scene 2
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Even though Antony has convinced the crowd that
Caesar.txt:Caesar was not ambitious and the conspirators are not
Caesar.txt:free access to all of Caesar’s papers, found Caesar’s will
Caesar.txt:the evening of the assassination. He intends to use it
Caesar.txt:now in an effort to manipulate the crowd by appealing
Caesar.txt:to its greedy nature. Having mentioned the will, the
Caesar.txt:crowd is, of course, filled with curiosity and the more
Caesar.txt:Antony declines to read the will the more insistent the
Caesar.txt:crowd becomes.
Caesar.txt:Antony’s next ploy to enrage the crowd draws on
Caesar.txt:sentimentality and the use of visual aids. Closing in on
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s body, Antony shows Caesar’s torn and bloody
Caesar.txt:robe to the awed crowd. He tells them that Caesar wore
Caesar.txt:that very cloak during the conquest of the Nervii and
Caesar.txt:that he remembers the first time Caesar put on the robe.
Caesar.txt:The Nervii was a very barbaric tribe living in Gaul but,
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:considering that Antony did not join Caesar in Gaul until
Caesar.txt:three years after the defeat of the Nervii, it is highly
Caesar.txt:unlikely that he actually remembered that particular battle, much less that particular robe. He then goes on to
Caesar.txt:point out each tear in the mantle and identify the man
Caesar.txt:who made each particular rent. Because Trebonius had
Caesar.txt:taken Antony away from the Capitol before the assassination, making sure he was nowhere near, it is impossible for Antony to know such information. But he is not
Caesar.txt:questioned, and the crowd is enraptured by his every
Caesar.txt:word. Moving to the cut that he claims Brutus made,
Caesar.txt:Antony describes it as “the most unkindest cut of all.”
Caesar.txt:If, as Plutarch suggests, Brutus stabbed Caesar in the
Caesar.txt:genitals, this is perhaps the only accurate statement
Caesar.txt:Antony has made in the past few lines.
Caesar.txt:Before Brutus left the Capitol, having turned the body
Caesar.txt:of Caesar over to Antony, he had instructed Antony to
Caesar.txt:“prepare the body.” By that, Brutus meant for Antony to
Caesar.txt:bathe Caesar’s body, dress the wounds so they would
Caesar.txt:not seep, and wrap the body in a fresh shroud. But
Caesar.txt:Antony intentionally chose not to do this. He leaves Caesar’s body in the same condition that he found it, and he
Caesar.txt:now shows that pitiful sight to the crowd. In this highly
Caesar.txt:charged moment, the people of Rome are moved to
Caesar.txt:tears of rage and sorrow, but Antony is not yet quite satisfied with the crowd’s emotional intensity. Now is the
Caesar.txt:moment to remind the people of Caesar’s will and its
Caesar.txt:contents. Informing the crowd of Caesar’s generosity is
Caesar.txt:the explosive fuel that enflames the mob into the frenzy
Caesar.txt:that Antony desires.
Caesar.txt:The image of fire as both a means of destruction and
Caesar.txt:purification is powerfully intermingled in the violence
Caesar.txt:and chaos unleashed in the final part of this scene. As
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s body is being sanctified through the ritual of
Caesar.txt:cremation, the crowd takes firebrands from the funeral
Caesar.txt:pyre to burn down the homes of the conspirators. Brutus and Cassius, along with the other conspirators, are
Caesar.txt:forced to escape from Rome, the city they had desired
Caesar.txt:to free.
Caesar.txt:Antony’s actions of turning the mob into a violent,
Caesar.txt:murderous force have often been criticized. But are his
Caesar.txt:actions any worse than those of the treasonous and
Caesar.txt:murdering conspirators?

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he crowd, enflamed by Antony’s passionate speech,
Caesar.txt:is out of control and looking for revenge. The mob
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:mentality that overpowers and replaces individual logic
Caesar.txt:takes hold of the Roman people and the poet, Helvius
Caesar.txt:Cinna, no relation to Cinna the conspirator, is one of the
Caesar.txt:doomed innocents to be victimized by the unthinking
Caesar.txt:mass. In a scene taken from the works of Plutarch, the
Caesar.txt:crowd confronts the poet and demands to know his
Caesar.txt:name. When told his name is Cinna, the mob disregards
Caesar.txt:his cries that he is not the conspirator of the same
Caesar.txt:name, and proceeds to tear the unfortunate poet to bits.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:smell as sweet.” In Act I of Julius Caesar, Cassius questions why Caesar’s name should be sounded with more
Caesar.txt:power than Brutus’. In this scene, Cinna is killed
Caesar.txt:because of his name. The label or image assigned to
Caesar.txt:something has become more important than the person
Caesar.txt:or object being named. The word “peace” can be
Caesar.txt:shouted over the mangled body of a slain leader, Portia
Caesar.txt:can maim her leg in an effort to live up to her father’s
Caesar.txt:name, and the crowds are content to let Brutus be
Caesar.txt:“Caesar.” The name, not the reality of what is beneath
Caesar.txt:it, takes on almost mythical proportions.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In addition to showing the consequences of a violent
Caesar.txt:and bloodthirsty mob, Shakespeare might have chosen
Caesar.txt:this particular episode from Plutarch to illustrate other
Caesar.txt:points as well. An issue that turns up in many of Shakespeare’s plays is the importance of a name. In Romeo
Caesar.txt:and Juliet for example, Juliet asks, “What’s in a name?
Caesar.txt:That which we call a rose / By any other word would
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:In times of civil unrest, truth seems to lose its importance and reality becomes relative to the perceiver. As
Caesar.txt:people who use words to uncover truth, poets have no
Caesar.txt:place in this world of chaos. It is symbolic perhaps that
Caesar.txt:Cinna the poet, the seeker of truth, is murdered rather
Caesar.txt:than Cinna the politician, who uses words to hide the
Caesar.txt:truth.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:lthough it seems that little time has passed between
Caesar.txt:the end of Act III and the beginning of Act IV, the
Caesar.txt:A
Caesar.txt:actual time between Caesar’s funeral and the forming
Caesar.txt:of the Second Triumvirate was over a year and a half. In
Caesar.txt:that time, Antony failed to win over the Senate and was
Caesar.txt:defeated by Decius Brutus’ army in Gaul. While Antony
Caesar.txt:was away from Rome, Octavius Caesar convinced the
Caesar.txt:Senate to recognize him as Caesar’s rightful heir and
Caesar.txt:had Mark Antony declared a public enemy. In the meantime, while Antony and Octavius were at odds with each
Caesar.txt:other, Brutus and Cassius gathered their forces and
Caesar.txt:amassed their power over the eastern portion of the
Caesar.txt:Roman republic.
Caesar.txt:Knowing that it was possible for Rome to fall into the
Caesar.txt:hands of the conspirators if Antony and Octavius continued to oppose each other, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,
Caesar.txt:a Roman general, successfully attempted to reconcile
Caesar.txt:the two men. In November of 43 B.C., the three men met
Caesar.txt:in Bononia and reached an agreement to form the Second Triumvirate, a three-man government comprised of
Caesar.txt:Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus.
Caesar.txt:Act IV opens on an horrific note as Antony, Octavius,
Caesar.txt:and Lepidus casually assemble a list of men who are to
Caesar.txt:die. The list includes not only enemies of the triumvirate
Caesar.txt:but friends and family members as well. The three men
Caesar.txt:bargain with each other, offering the death of a nephew
Caesar.txt:for the death of a brother. This gruesome game clearly
Caesar.txt:illustrates the viciousness and atrocities created by illmanaged insurrection.
Caesar.txt:Motivated by his obsession to revenge Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:death, Antony’s savage and unscrupulous character is
Caesar.txt:further revealed as the scene progresses. In his passionate funeral speech, Antony used Caesar’s will to
Caesar.txt:enflame the crowd to do his bidding. Now, he looks for
Caesar.txt:ways to cheat those same people of their legacies. From
Caesar.txt:his comments concerning Lepidus, it becomes clear
Caesar.txt:that Antony uses and manipulates people as easily as
Caesar.txt:he used and manipulated words in his funeral oration.
Caesar.txt:Antony’s regard for humanity, except in terms of property and serviceability, is nonexistent.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Mark Antony.
Caesar.txt:Ronald Sheridan/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:This scene becomes a fascinating parallel to Act II,
Caesar.txt:Scene 1, in which the conspirators also have a conversation about who should live or die. In contrast to the
Caesar.txt:quick and ruthless manner of the triumvirate in choosing those to eliminate, the ineffectual, almost illogical
Caesar.txt:manner used by the conspirators in discussing Antony’s
Caesar.txt:fate begins to look nearly noble. Although possibly
Caesar.txt:spurred by jealousy in Cassius or a misplaced sense of
Caesar.txt:honor in Brutus, the bottom line for the conspirators’
Caesar.txt:attack on Caesar was for the betterment of their beloved
Caesar.txt:Rome. This scene provides a sharp contrast between
Caesar.txt:the motivations of Brutus and Cassius and those of
Caesar.txt:Antony and Octavius and clearly illustrates that compared to the new triumvirate, Caesar was a rather harmless tyrant.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:or the first time in the play, the location shifts from
Caesar.txt:Rome to Sardis, the capital of Lydia, a kingdom in
Caesar.txt:F
Caesar.txt:Asia Minor. Again, Shakespeare seems to draw a comparison between the forces of Antony and Octavius and
Caesar.txt:Brutus and Cassius. Although there is evidence of
Caesar.txt:power struggles beginning between Antony and
Caesar.txt:Octavius in the previous scene, the two men remain
Caesar.txt:united in their purposes. This scene clearly establishes
Caesar.txt:the fact that the relationship between Brutus and Cassius has seriously deteriorated, reflecting a larger picture of discord within the republican cause.
Caesar.txt:The issue of friendship that pervades Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:is especially evident in this scene and the next. The
Caesar.txt:word “love” and its variants occurs fifty-six times in
Caesar.txt:the course of the play and here Brutus discloses that
Caesar.txt:his friendship with Cassius is “cooling” and the love
Caesar.txt:that had once been between them has begun to
Caesar.txt:“sicken and decay.” The breech between the two men
Caesar.txt:is a direct result of the conflict between the realist and
Caesar.txt:the idealist. Even in the horrific aftermath of the assassination, Brutus has not lost his naivete, and his personal principles still take precedence over his personal
Caesar.txt:relationships.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ preoccupation with how situations appear to
Caesar.txt:others is obviously still of great concern to him. When
Caesar.txt:Cassius publicly accuses Brutus of wrongdoing, Brutus
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:cuts him off and admonishes him for speaking so candidly before the armies. That the morale of the troops
Caesar.txt:could be adversely affected by witnessing an argument
Caesar.txt:between the two leaders is obvious, but it is also likely
Caesar.txt:that Brutus would not want to be seen as out of control
Caesar.txt:or have his faults recounted in a public setting. The fiery
Caesar.txt:and passionate Cassius continues to subordinate himself to Brutus. At Brutus’ request, Cassius subdues himself and the two men move within Brutus’ tent to
Caesar.txt:continue airing their frustrations.
Caesar.txt:In the 1623 Folio, there is no division between Scenes
Caesar.txt:2 and 3 in Act IV. The separation of the two scenes was
Caesar.txt:actually executed by Alexander Pope in his edition of
Caesar.txt:the plays published in the early 1700s. Pope’s rationale
Caesar.txt:for dividing the two scenes was that Brutus and Cassius
Caesar.txt:move from one place to another. Because there were
Caesar.txt:no major scenery changes possible on the stage of the
Caesar.txt:Globe Theatre and there has been no evidence of tents
Caesar.txt:set up on the stage as in Richard III, it is most likely that
Caesar.txt:the other characters listed in the stage directions
Caesar.txt:merely left the stage, leaving Brutus and Cassius alone
Caesar.txt:to continue the scene. However, the majority of modern
Caesar.txt:editors have retained the division of the two scenes.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he quarrel between Brutus and Cassius is a very
Caesar.txt:short episode in Plutarch’s version of the Life of BruT
Caesar.txt:tus, but Shakespeare clearly understood the dramatic
Caesar.txt:potential in the argument and turned it into one of the
Caesar.txt:most highly acclaimed scenes in all of his plays. The
Caesar.txt:poet Leonard Digges, in a poem included in the Introduction to the 1623 First Folio, mentions the “parlying
Caesar.txt:Romans” and in a longer version of the poem printed in
Caesar.txt:the 1640 edition of Shakespeare’s Poems writes:
Caesar.txt:So have I seene, when Cesar would
Caesar.txt:appeare,
Caesar.txt:And on the Stage at half-sword parley
Caesar.txt:were,
Caesar.txt:Brutus and Cassius: Oh how the Audience,
Caesar.txt:Were ravish’d, with what wonder they
Caesar.txt:went thence. . . .
Caesar.txt:Even in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
Caesar.txt:when the play Julius Caesar was considered by many
Caesar.txt:critics one of Shakespeare’s lesser plays, the quarrel
Caesar.txt:scene between Brutus and Cassius was thought to be
Caesar.txt:a shining example of Shakespeare’s better work.
Caesar.txt:Samuel Johnson, who did not like the play, called the
Caesar.txt:scene one to be “universally celebrated,” and the poet
Caesar.txt:Samuel Taylor Coleridge cited the scene as evidence of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s “genius being superhuman.”
Caesar.txt:The inevitable clash between Cassius’ cynical realism and Brutus’ stubborn idealism not only makes for
Caesar.txt:excellent drama but also brings to light the larger issues
Caesar.txt:of morality and ethics within rebellion. Cassius is well
Caesar.txt:aware that it takes money to maintain an army and it is
Caesar.txt:not always possible to obtain the needed funds in honorable ways. Cassius sees nothing wrong, under the
Caesar.txt:circumstances, with doing whatever is necessary,
Caesar.txt:including overlooking a “nice offence” such as bribery,
Caesar.txt:to secure the money needed to support the men in his
Caesar.txt:army. Instead of viewing Cassius’ fundraising activities
Caesar.txt:as necessary evils in a time of war, Brutus, impaired by
Caesar.txt:the blinders of nobility, can only see it as corruption.
Caesar.txt:Later in the scene, Brutus, having just condemned Cassius for obtaining money through extortion, now castigates Cassius for not sharing with him the spoils of his
Caesar.txt:efforts. Ironically, Brutus, accusing Cassius of contaminating “our fingers with base bribes,” fails to recognize
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:his own participation in corruption when he insisted the
Caesar.txt:conspirators contaminate their fingers with the blood of
Caesar.txt:the murdered Caesar.
Caesar.txt:In lines 38–47, Brutus accuses Cassius of being
Caesar.txt:“choleric.” Elizabethans believed that emotional stability along with general health depended on a proper balance of four fluids or humours within the body. The four
Caesar.txt:cardinal humours were blood, phlegm, choler (yellow
Caesar.txt:bile), and melancholy (black bile), and it was thought
Caesar.txt:that the mixtures of these elements would determine a
Caesar.txt:person’s temperament. A well-proportioned mixture of
Caesar.txt:all four elements would result in a person who was balanced and healthy. However, a person with a predominance of one fluid produced someone who was either
Caesar.txt:sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, or melancholic. The
Caesar.txt:choleric man, or Cassius in Brutus’ opinion, would have
Caesar.txt:been quick to anger, lean, arrogant, ambitious, malicious, and sly.
Caesar.txt:The argument between the two men disintegrates
Caesar.txt:into an almost pathetic childlike squabble. For the
Caesar.txt:moment, Brutus replaces his stoic nature with one of
Caesar.txt:petulance and becomes a man who torments, intimidates, and belittles the man he calls a friend. Cassius
Caesar.txt:questions Brutus’ definition of friendship and suggests
Caesar.txt:that a true friend would not chronicle every fault of that
Caesar.txt:friend only to later “cast” every mistake “into my teeth.”
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ arrogance becomes so exaggerated that his
Caesar.txt:declarations become reminiscent of the ones spoken by
Caesar.txt:Caesar right before his death. Just as Caesar referred
Caesar.txt:to himself in terms of an Olympian god in Act III, Brutus,
Caesar.txt:using the same term, takes on the identical tones of
Caesar.txt:pomposity and conceit. Shakespeare continues to draw
Caesar.txt:a parallel between Brutus and Caesar and, at this point,
Caesar.txt:it would be difficult to distinguish one man from the
Caesar.txt:other.
Caesar.txt:Just as he exposed his chest to the storm in Act I,
Caesar.txt:Cassius now offers his “naked breast” to Brutus’ dagger. Just as he bears his chest, Cassius is a man who
Caesar.txt:openly bears his soul. Unlike Brutus, Cassius cannot
Caesar.txt:hide his feelings behind a philosophy. He is “aweary of
Caesar.txt:the world,” and his exhaustion comes not only from the
Caesar.txt:efforts on behalf of freedom for Rome but also from constantly trying to prove his love to Brutus. On every occasion, he has foresworn his own better judgment in an
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:effort to placate Brutus. He has done the dirty work
Caesar.txt:required to keep their armies intact and now, Brutus can
Caesar.txt:do nothing but condemn and accuse and place himself
Caesar.txt:above Cassius, declaring superiority both ethically and
Caesar.txt:morally. As the quarrel comes to an end, the once passionate Cassius now appears beaten and forlorn but, as
Caesar.txt:is expected, it is Cassius who swallows his pride and
Caesar.txt:instigates the reconciliation between the two men.
Caesar.txt:The entrance of the poet into the scene at this
Caesar.txt:moment is more than an episode of comic relief.
Caesar.txt:According to Plutarch, the poet who entered the fray
Caesar.txt:was a cynic philosopher by the name of Marcus Phaonius, but if the actor playing the poet was, as is often
Caesar.txt:speculated, William Shakespeare himself, the scene
Caesar.txt:takes on a more complex meaning. As evidenced in Act
Caesar.txt:III, poets do not prosper in times of civil unrest. Cinna
Caesar.txt:was torn limb from limb and, although this poet walks
Caesar.txt:away with his life, he is insulted and harshly dismissed.
Caesar.txt:The message brought by the poet to the two generals is
Caesar.txt:a simple but powerful one: “Love and be friends.” The
Caesar.txt:job of the poet is to uncover truth and beauty, and the
Caesar.txt:truth revealed in this short scene is the importance of
Caesar.txt:love: love between friends, love of country, love of
Caesar.txt:proper ideals. Since the funeral speech, no one has
Caesar.txt:mentioned the love of Rome or the love of freedom. Love
Caesar.txt:between individuals has been replaced with ambition
Caesar.txt:and petty concerns and, as a result, the world is at odds
Caesar.txt:and on the brink of destruction. Instead of listening to
Caesar.txt:the poet however, Brutus labels him an empty, vulgar
Caesar.txt:fool and ignores the most important theme presented in
Caesar.txt:the play: “to love and be friends.”
Caesar.txt:Following the exit of the poet, Brutus reveals that his
Caesar.txt:wife, Portia, has died. According to Plutarch, Portia
Caesar.txt:killed herself by putting hot coals in her mouth, but
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s description of “swallowing fire”
Caesar.txt:enforces the continuing imagery of destruction by fire.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ stoicism is no more evident than in the telling of
Caesar.txt:his wife’s death, but it is possible that his sorrow and
Caesar.txt:grief was the cause of his uncharacteristic show of
Caesar.txt:emotion as he quarreled with Cassius.
Caesar.txt:Almost as soon as Brutus has told Cassius of Portia’s
Caesar.txt:death, Messala enters to report the news of Portia’s
Caesar.txt:death to Brutus. The retelling of the information seems
Caesar.txt:an almost unnecessary detail within the scene. Many
Caesar.txt:scholars speculate that Shakespeare revised the play,
Caesar.txt:writing the first telling of Portia’s death (lines 147–156)
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act IV, Scene 3
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:139
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:to replace the second (lines 179–192) in an attempt to
Caesar.txt:avoid making Brutus look totally emotionless, but the
Caesar.txt:printer failed to delete the second passage.
Caesar.txt:Closer examination, however, might point to the second telling as a way of further revealing Brutus’ character. Messala enters the scene accompanied by
Caesar.txt:Titinius. Cassius, still in shock over Portia’s demise, verbally laments her death but is quieted by Brutus with,
Caesar.txt:“No more, I pray you.” Brutus goes on to deny having
Caesar.txt:any news of Portia, after just telling Cassius of her death
Caesar.txt:and, when Messala tells him of her death, Brutus’
Caesar.txt:response is calm to the point of uncaring. Brutus,
Caesar.txt:always concerned with his public image, could have put
Caesar.txt:on this show of stoic resignation to impress Messala,
Caesar.txt:knowing that word of his response would spread
Caesar.txt:through the camp and, indeed, Messala calls Brutus a
Caesar.txt:great man. By this point, Shakespeare has so merged
Caesar.txt:the characters of Brutus and Caesar that Brutus’ words,
Caesar.txt:rather than being just reminiscent of Caesar’s words,
Caesar.txt:begin to echo exact thoughts. For example, in Act II,
Caesar.txt:Caesar remarks that “death, a necessary end, / Will
Caesar.txt:come when it will come.” Brutus in Act IV declares,
Caesar.txt:“We must die, Messala. / With meditating that she must
Caesar.txt:die once, / I have the patience to endure it now.” The
Caesar.txt:retelling of Portia’s death, rather than being a compositor’s error, allows Shakespeare to continue to thematically metamorphose the two men into one.
Caesar.txt:Messala also brings the news of the deaths of the
Caesar.txt:senators proscribed by Antony and Octavius. Although
Caesar.txt:Messala reports the death of 100 senators, Brutus has
Caesar.txt:heard of only 70. Again, confusion reigns in war and
Caesar.txt:within the ranks of Brutus’ and Cassius’ armies. Messala also tells of the death of Cicero. Marc Antony
Caesar.txt:ordered the death of Cicero and, even though Cicero
Caesar.txt:had been one of Octavius’ few early supporters,
Caesar.txt:Octavius agreed to list Cicero for death. Knowing he
Caesar.txt:was marked for death, Cicero tried to escape from Italy
Caesar.txt:but the ship in which he was sailing was blown back to
Caesar.txt:shore. Instead of making another attempt to escape,
Caesar.txt:Cicero waited for the soldiers sent to kill him and without further resistance, died at their hands in December
Caesar.txt:of 43 B.C.
Caesar.txt:The next order of business is the discussion of military strategy. Because Antony and Octavius are known
Caesar.txt:to be advancing towards Phillipi, Brutus suggests that
Caesar.txt:they march their own armies to meet them there.
Caesar.txt:

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act IV, Scene 3
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Cassius, the more experienced soldier, disagrees, arguing logically that if they stay where they are, their soldiers will be rested and better able to do battle. Brutus’
Caesar.txt:ever expanding ego intervenes and he vetoes Cassius’
Caesar.txt:idea saying, “Good reasons must of force give place to
Caesar.txt:better.” Brutus behaves dictatorially and his brazen
Caesar.txt:over-confidence makes it more and more difficult to differentiate between the tyranny of the dead Caesar and
Caesar.txt:the tyranny of the living Brutus. Cassius makes a very
Caesar.txt:feeble attempt to speak further on the matter but Brutus refuses to listen. Instead, he emotes on the importance of acting when the moment is right. Ironically, of
Caesar.txt:course, Brutus has yet to ever act at the proper time and
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s theory holds true that time, and Brutus’
Caesar.txt:relationship to it, remains out of kilter. Brutus himself
Caesar.txt:has become an anachronism.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:the fact that the ghost identifies itself as evil would be
Caesar.txt:proof that Brutus is, at least subconsciously, aware that
Caesar.txt:the murder of Caesar and the ensuing chaos was
Caesar.txt:immoral. The second interpretation of Caesar’s ghost
Caesar.txt:would be as an actual apparition. Both the Romans and
Caesar.txt:the Elizabethans were superstitious people who
Caesar.txt:unequivocally believed in the existence of ghosts. Either
Caesar.txt:interpretation, however, serves to show that Brutus, like
Caesar.txt:Caesar before his death, has become superstitious. It is
Caesar.txt:a fulfillment of Antony’s prophecy that Caesar’s spirit
Caesar.txt:has “come hot from hell” and it foreshadows the defeat
Caesar.txt:of the republican forces and the death of Brutus at
Caesar.txt:Phillipi.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:After everyone leaves the tent, Brutus dons his nightgown and literally transforms himself from his public
Caesar.txt:image into his private self. As with Portia in Act II, when
Caesar.txt:Brutus drops the mask of the stoic politician he
Caesar.txt:becomes a caring, concerned man who can admit mistakes and find humor in his situation. In this very short
Caesar.txt:segment of almost domestic bliss, it becomes obvious
Caesar.txt:that Brutus was much more suited for the pleasures of
Caesar.txt:the home than the perils of politics. In a very real sense,
Caesar.txt:he seems to be a man forced into a role he was not
Caesar.txt:made to play.
Caesar.txt:Into this short-lived moment of peace comes the
Caesar.txt:ghost of Julius Caesar. The episode, rather than being
Caesar.txt:an invention of Shakespeare’s dramatic imagination, is
Caesar.txt:actually taken from Plutarch’s record of events. In his
Caesar.txt:accounting, Plutarch relates that the ghost identified
Caesar.txt:itself as Brutus’ “evil spirit.” There are at least two possible ways of interpreting the appearance of Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:ghost. The first would be to portray the ghost as the
Caesar.txt:manifestation of Brutus’ troubled mind and guilty conscience. Brutus is exhausted by his angry episode with
Caesar.txt:Cassius and full of grief over the death of Portia. The
Caesar.txt:recent deaths of the senators, the inevitable deaths that
Caesar.txt:will occur in the upcoming battles, and the possibility of
Caesar.txt:his own death cannot be far from Brutus’ thoughts. If
Caesar.txt:the ghost were the outward form of Brutus’ conscience,
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar.

Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:fter the appearance of Ceasar’s ghost, Brutus commanded that the armies begin their march toward
Caesar.txt:A
Caesar.txt:Phillipi, a major city in the province of Macedonia,
Caesar.txt:located about ten miles north of the Aegean Sea. A
Caesar.txt:small skirmish had actually ensued between the opposing forces of Antony and Octavius and Brutus and Cassius before the battle in this scene takes place. The
Caesar.txt:result was that the armies of the conspiracy, although
Caesar.txt:outnumbered by Antony’s and Octavius’ army, had commandeered a strategically superior location. Positioned
Caesar.txt:high in the hills, Brutus and Cassius could have been
Caesar.txt:victorious by simply delaying any action while Antony
Caesar.txt:and Octavius’ armies tried to exist on the unprotected
Caesar.txt:and swampy plains of the area.
Caesar.txt:From Octavius’ first speech, it becomes clear that
Caesar.txt:Brutus and Cassius have made the characteristically
Caesar.txt:unwise decision to descend from the hills onto the
Caesar.txt:plains and Antony is amazed but thankful at the turn of
Caesar.txt:events. Antony believes that the conspirators are
Caesar.txt:attacking rather than waiting out the progression of
Caesar.txt:events so as not to look cowardly. Based on Antony’s
Caesar.txt:conjecture, and the previous examples of Brutus’ military acumen, it would not be too difficult to guess who
Caesar.txt:made the decision to move from the hills onto the plains
Caesar.txt:of Phillipi.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Antony gives Octavius orders to fight on the left side
Caesar.txt:of the field, and, in the first overt sign of dissension
Caesar.txt:between the two men, Octavius argues with Antony
Caesar.txt:insisting that he be the one to fight on the left side.
Caesar.txt:Octavius eventually concedes to Antony’s command to
Caesar.txt:fight on the left, but he warns Antony that in this matter,
Caesar.txt:“I do not cross you; but I will do so.” Indeed, Octavius
Caesar.txt:does keep his word and triumphs over Antony in Shakespeare’s telling of Antony and Cleopatra.
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ call for “Words before blows” is a tradition
Caesar.txt:more medieval than Roman; in medieval times, it was
Caesar.txt:customary to exchange insults before battle. The tradition allows Shakespeare to establish the animosity
Caesar.txt:between the two sides using verbal rather than physical combat. The task of producing a battle scene on a
Caesar.txt:small stage with a limited number of actors is always
Caesar.txt:difficult. By using verbal assault, rapid action, swift
Caesar.txt:scene changes, and one-on-one combat, Shakespeare
Caesar.txt:is able to create the illusion of a larger battle. The
Caesar.txt:exchange would also entertain an Elizabethan audience
Caesar.txt:with its quick and biting wit.
Caesar.txt:Octavius hurls threats and insults at Brutus and
Caesar.txt:Cassius and swears he was not meant to die upon Brutus’ sword. Brutus replies, “O, if thou wert the noblest
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:150
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act V, Scene 1
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:of thy strain, / Young man, thou couldst not die more
Caesar.txt:honourable.” Even in the face of battle and the very real
Caesar.txt:possibility of death, Brutus’ conceit is not humbled. Brutus has, in essence, become Caesar; and Octavius, no
Caesar.txt:longer being referred to as Octavius, has taken the name
Caesar.txt:of Caesar. Indeed, the spirit of Julius Caesar has
Caesar.txt:metaphorically possessed both men, and while his ghost
Caesar.txt:roams the fields of Philippi, Caesar’s influence is even
Caesar.txt:more powerful and efficacious in death than it was in life.
Caesar.txt:Cassius condemns Antony for being like a “peevish
Caesar.txt:school boy” and Antony replies, “Old Cassius still!”
Caesar.txt:However, unlike Brutus, whose character has remained
Caesar.txt:fairly static, Cassius has changed considerably throughout the course of the play. He is no longer the Cassius
Caesar.txt:of Act I. In the beginning, he was a Machiavellian-type
Caesar.txt:character who was able to deviously persuade Brutus
Caesar.txt:to join the conspiracy. Caesar saw him as a dangerous
Caesar.txt:man who observed too much and spent too much time
Caesar.txt:in thought. From his rather cold and calculating introduction, a shrewd but passionate man has emerged.
Caesar.txt:Cassius is a loyal man who treasures his friendships,
Caesar.txt:but because he underestimates his own worth, he, too,
Caesar.txt:often represses his better judgment — and with dire
Caesar.txt:consequences. As he witnesses the imminent failure of
Caesar.txt:the dreams of the conspiracy, Cassius, acknowledging
Caesar.txt:the part his abject silence has played, is consumed with
Caesar.txt:depression.
Caesar.txt:Throughout the entire play, Cassius consistently
Caesar.txt:bends to the will of Brutus. Watching the death and
Caesar.txt:destruction brought about by Brutus’ mistaken judgment
Caesar.txt:must have been very difficult for the more astute Cassius. In a moment of clarity, Cassius is able to observe
Caesar.txt:his own fatal flaw, the suppression of his wisdom to the
Caesar.txt:whims of Brutus, and he can no longer remain silent.
Caesar.txt:Possibly brought on by the stress of battle and a premonition of the inevitable outcome, Cassius finally
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:releases his angry frustration asserting, “Now Brutus,
Caesar.txt:thank yourself! / This tongue had not offended so to-day
Caesar.txt:/ If Cassius might have ruled.”
Caesar.txt:As the two opposing forces disperse to begin the
Caesar.txt:battle, Cassius further reveals the many changes that
Caesar.txt:have taken place in his character. He confides to Messala evidence of his discontent with Brutus’ decisionmaking. For the first time, he publicly admits that he is
Caesar.txt:going into this battle against his will, and he fears that
Caesar.txt:the outcome will be devastation for the conspiracy. In
Caesar.txt:opposition to his earlier disbelief in signs and omens,
Caesar.txt:Cassius now dreads the possibly ominous portents of
Caesar.txt:this battle being fought on his birthday. He takes note
Caesar.txt:that the fall of the birds that had followed them to
Caesar.txt:Philippi might well be a sign of impending death. Shakespeare’s use of the imagery in the description of the
Caesar.txt:shadows cast by the birds as a “canopy most fatal”
Caesar.txt:foreshadows an apocalyptic ending. Cassius’ Epicurean
Caesar.txt:philosophy, the belief that the gods did not meddle in
Caesar.txt:human events, making signs and omens invalid, gives
Caesar.txt:way to a more Stoic position, and Cassius seems to
Caesar.txt:resign himself to his predestined fate.
Caesar.txt:Cassius is not the only one to change a long-held
Caesar.txt:belief. For Brutus, the idea of suicide is “cowardly and
Caesar.txt:vile” but when weighed in comparison to imprisonment
Caesar.txt:and public humiliation, Brutus swears he will opt for suicide. Again, his own self image is the reason behind his
Caesar.txt:decision. He tells Cassius that Brutus will never “go
Caesar.txt:bound to Rome. / He bears too great a mind.”
Caesar.txt:Both men, sensing their imminent death and the
Caesar.txt:defeat of the conspiracy, say their final good-byes.
Caesar.txt:Despite their differences, they shared a very intense
Caesar.txt:common experience, and they are bound together by
Caesar.txt:circumstance and friendship.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he last few moments of Cassius’ life are filled with
Caesar.txt:both irony and a sense of nobility. Ironically, his own
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:men are beginning to show signs of mutiny; Brutus has
Caesar.txt:again given bad military advice, ordering the attack too
Caesar.txt:early; and, instead of joining forces to help Cassius’
Caesar.txt:army defeat Antony, the honorable Brutus’ men have
Caesar.txt:begun to loot and pillage the enemy’s camp. Cassius,
Caesar.txt:faced with defeat and the continuing fatal mistakes of
Caesar.txt:his friend Brutus, does not back down. Instead, he has
Caesar.txt:rescued his battle flag and killed the coward who tried
Caesar.txt:to abscond with it. Even though Antony is moving closer
Caesar.txt:to Cassius’ position, he refuses to retreat any further,
Caesar.txt:and he mourns over what he perceives as the capture
Caesar.txt:of his “best friend.” Cassius’ final act before his death
Caesar.txt:is to offer freedom to his slave, Pindarus.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:unnecessary mistake, but only in dying can Cassius
Caesar.txt:finally escape the bonds of Julius Caesar’s power.
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare again depicts the analogy between the
Caesar.txt:individual and the universe in Titinius’ final homage to
Caesar.txt:Cassius. The course of a man’s life is metaphorically
Caesar.txt:connected to the course of the sun in a single day, with
Caesar.txt:sunrise being birth and sunset being death. In this
Caesar.txt:speech, the images of the red rays of the sun, with a pun
Caesar.txt:on son, are symbolic of the red blood seeping from Cassius’ dying body. With Cassius’ death, night is come for
Caesar.txt:Rome and the ideals of freedom and liberty that he held
Caesar.txt:dear are thrown into darkness.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:One of Cassius’ fatal flaws is revealed when he asks
Caesar.txt:Pindarus to relate to him what is happening to Titinius.
Caesar.txt:In an ironic twist, Cassius, who condemned Caesar
Caesar.txt:because of his physical ailments, reveals that his “sight
Caesar.txt:was ever thick.” Cassius’ shortsightedness has
Caesar.txt:metaphorically and now literally wreaked havoc
Caesar.txt:throughout the entire play. He has been unable to really
Caesar.txt:see what the people of Rome wanted in a leader. He
Caesar.txt:was blind to Brutus’ inability to lead the conspiracy, and
Caesar.txt:his blindness will now result in his own death.
Caesar.txt:Cassius, overcome with melancholy, seems
Caesar.txt:resigned to die, “this day I breathed first.” Unseeing or
Caesar.txt:misreading the chain of events, he does not wait for
Caesar.txt:confirmation of Titinius’ fate but rather asks Pindarus
Caesar.txt:to assist him in suicide. Early in the play, Cicero noted
Caesar.txt:that, “men may construe things after their own fashion” and now Titinius, almost echoing his words cries,
Caesar.txt:“Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything.” It is poetic
Caesar.txt:justice that Cassius is impaled with the very sword that
Caesar.txt:he used to kill Caesar and, as he dies, Cassius calls out
Caesar.txt:to Caesar, giving the impression that perhaps Brutus
Caesar.txt:is not the only member of the conspiracy who has been
Caesar.txt:haunted by the spirit of Caesar. Cassius’ death is an
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Mary Evans Picture Library
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:Titinius is devastated by the death of his friend Cassius. Feeling responsible for Cassius’ death, Titinius
Caesar.txt:feels that it was an act of courage to commit suicide
Caesar.txt:rather than live shamefully as the man who caused the
Caesar.txt:death of Cassius. Just like Antony who, proclaiming his
Caesar.txt:love and loyalty to his slain friend, asked to die with the
Caesar.txt:same sword and within the same hour as Caesar,
Caesar.txt:Titinius chooses to take his own life with Cassius’
Caesar.txt:sword.
Caesar.txt:Finding the bodies of Cassius and Titinius, Brutus
Caesar.txt:proclaims, “O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet! / Thy
Caesar.txt:spirit walks abroad and turns our swords / In our own
Caesar.txt:proper entrails.” Just as Antony prophesied in Act III,
Caesar.txt:Scene 1, “Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, / With Ate
Caesar.txt:by his side” has “come hot from hell.”
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Act V, Scene 3
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:157
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Reclaiming his Stoic philosophy, Brutus covers up
Caesar.txt:any pain he may actually feel at the loss of Cassius. He
Caesar.txt:proclaims he will cry later and asks that the body not be
Caesar.txt:placed in the camp, lest it upset the troops. Having
Caesar.txt:quickly disposed of the issue of Cassius, Brutus, noting
Caesar.txt:the time as “three o’clock,” calls the troops together for
Caesar.txt:one last fight. Just moments before, Titinius had
Caesar.txt:remarked on the setting sun and the red rays of the
Caesar.txt:dying light, so, once again, Brutus has misjudged the
Caesar.txt:time as he drags the remains of his beaten army into the
Caesar.txt:final battle.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:his scene should be played very quickly and with as
Caesar.txt:much commotion as possible. It is the final battle to
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:be fought before the war is brought to an end, and it
Caesar.txt:should illustrate the Republican commitment to the
Caesar.txt:cause but the futility of the attempt. The action also
Caesar.txt:shows a marked difference between the frenetic activity of Brutus’ men and the almost calm confidence of
Caesar.txt:Antony and his soldiers.
Caesar.txt:Despite the fact that Brutus’ decisions have been
Caesar.txt:directly responsible for the downfall of the conspiracy
Caesar.txt:and the death of many soldiers, Brutus’ men remain
Caesar.txt:loyal to him and to the cause of the Republic. Just as
Caesar.txt:Portia died trying to live up to the reputation of her
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:father, her younger brother, Marcus Cato, will also die
Caesar.txt:attempting to uphold the family name on behalf of Brutus. In another tactic taken from medieval tradition,
Caesar.txt:Lucilius, a decoy, pretends to be Brutus in an attempt to
Caesar.txt:protect the actual Brutus from being captured in battle.
Caesar.txt:Antony quickly recognizes that this man is not Brutus,
Caesar.txt:but instead of taking Lucilius prisoner, he commands his
Caesar.txt:soldiers to “keep this man safe.” Antony knows the fight
Caesar.txt:is all but over and that the death toll needs rise no
Caesar.txt:higher. Just as Caesar forgave many of the men who

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:COMMENTARY
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:he last battle is fought. The war is finished. Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:death is avenged. Despondent over lost causes and
Caesar.txt:T
Caesar.txt:lost friends, Brutus is a “vessel full of grief” whose stoicism no longer comforts him. Finally, Brutus has the
Caesar.txt:time to shed the tears he promised Cassius.
Caesar.txt:Brutus knows that his options at this point are limited and, as he promised earlier, he chooses to take his
Caesar.txt:own life rather than become a prisoner. Brutus has once
Caesar.txt:again been visited by the ghost of Caesar, and he interprets the second sighting as a sign that his “hour is
Caesar.txt:come.” With alarums sounding throughout the scene, a
Caesar.txt:sense of extreme urgency is felt. The arrival of Antony
Caesar.txt:and Octavius is imminent, and Brutus must act quickly
Caesar.txt:if he is to avoid imprisonment.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Brutus tells his “life’s history” as he would wish it to
Caesar.txt:read, full of nobility and valiant deeds, but the story history tells of his life is far different. Brutus dies not only a
Caesar.txt:victim of his own sword, but also a victim of his own
Caesar.txt:delusions.
Caesar.txt:In his eulogy over Brutus’ lifeless body, Antony
Caesar.txt:praises Brutus as “the noblest Roman of them all.”
Caesar.txt:Words spoken at funerals often ignore the bad and glorify the good, but the last time Antony spoke those
Caesar.txt:words, they were loaded with sarcasm and innuendo,
Caesar.txt:aimed at bringing about the death and destruction of the
Caesar.txt:very man lying before him. Does he now speak those
Caesar.txt:words with the same sarcasm or do his words ring with
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Even in the face of death and defeat, Brutus is unable
Caesar.txt:to see the reality of his life: “My heart doth joy that yet
Caesar.txt:in all my life / I found no man but he was true to me.”
Caesar.txt:Brutus ignores the fact that Cassius manipulated him to
Caesar.txt:entice him to join the conspiracy and Antony undermined his funeral speech and turned all of Rome against
Caesar.txt:him. He also chooses to ignore that these men whom he
Caesar.txt:is asking to help him avoid imprisonment will, with the
Caesar.txt:exception of Strato, fail to do so, running away before
Caesar.txt:they, too, can be caught. Brutus fails to realize that, in
Caesar.txt:the course of this play, the only person who was ever
Caesar.txt:true to him was the man who pardoned him for his allegiance to Pompey and welcomed him with open arms
Caesar.txt:into his home and into his Senate. Julius Caesar, who
Caesar.txt:died under the weight of Brutus’ betrayal, was the only
Caesar.txt:man who Brutus could say was actually “true to me.”
Caesar.txt:To the very end of his life, Brutus is concerned with
Caesar.txt:how he will be perceived by the public after his death
Caesar.txt:and where he will be placed in the annals of history. He
Caesar.txt:tells his remaining soldiers, “I shall have glory by this losing day / More than Octavius and Mark Antony / By this
Caesar.txt:vile conquest shall attain unto.” His tone is almost boastful and his sense of self-importance sadly misguided. As
Caesar.txt:most men face the end of their lives, they review their
Caesar.txt:own actions and make amends for their own transgressions. Brutus, to the end, lives the unexamined life. He
Caesar.txt:labels Antony’s efforts to revenge the death of Caesar as
Caesar.txt:“vile” but he never displays any remorse for the part he
Caesar.txt:played in causing Caesar’s death nor does he accept his
Caesar.txt:share of the responsibility for the war that was waged
Caesar.txt:by Antony and Octavius. As he has done his entire life,
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:truthfulness? Having successfully avenged Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:death, perhaps Antony realizes that it is time for Caesar’s spirit to rest. It is time for peace to return to Rome.
Caesar.txt:Antony is a politician as well as a soldier and must
Caesar.txt:understand that the only way to truly achieve that peace
Caesar.txt:is to honor and thus forgive (at least publicly) the fallen
Caesar.txt:leader of the conspiracy, paving the way for unity and
Caesar.txt:reconciliation in Rome.
Caesar.txt:Octavius gives the orders for Brutus’ burial, calls an
Caesar.txt:end to the war and sends everyone away, “To part the
Caesar.txt:glories of this happy day.” By ending Julius Caesar with
Caesar.txt:everyone exiting to tell their own version of the day’s
Caesar.txt:events, Shakespeare subtly underlines the way history
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:is often retold to suit the teller. In Shakespeare’s time,
Caesar.txt:the Tudor family from which Elizabeth I descended had
Caesar.txt:almost completely rewritten the history of the Plantagenets, the family that ruled England before them, and
Caesar.txt:this theme of history rewritten runs throughout many of
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare’s history plays, including Henry V and
Caesar.txt:Richard III.
Caesar.txt:Octavius speaks the last words of the play and, in
Caesar.txt:doing so, establishes himself as the dominant figure of
Caesar.txt:authority in the new regime. This new Caesar will
Caesar.txt:become a powerful force in Rome, and his story continues in Shakespeare’s telling of Antony and Cleopatra.

Caesar.txt:6. Hot Seat: Choose five or six main characters
Caesar.txt:from the play. Divide the class into groups,
Caesar.txt:with each person in the group assigned one of
Caesar.txt:the chosen characters. Students then break
Caesar.txt:from their “home” group and move into a

Caesar.txt:group. Each student will then write nonstop
Caesar.txt:for about five minutes an interior dialogue (in
Caesar.txt:first person only) relating the thoughts and
Caesar.txt:feelings of the character. Students then share
Caesar.txt:what they have written within the character
Caesar.txt:group. Next, the students help each other create a minimum of two questions from the perspective of their characters for the characters
Caesar.txt:that are not their own. The Caesar group
Caesar.txt:might come up with a question for Brutus such
Caesar.txt:as, “Why did you betray me?” Students then

Caesar.txt:ANSWERS
Caesar.txt:Identify the Quotation
Caesar.txt:1. Speaker: Cassius; Person spoken to: Brutus;
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Location: Act I, Scene 2; Comments: This line
Caesar.txt:shows Cassius as a man of action, one who is
Caesar.txt:willing to create his destiny, not rely on the
Caesar.txt:fates. It also underlines Cassius’ envy that he is
Caesar.txt:an “underling” to Caesar.
Caesar.txt:2. Speaker: Caesar; Person spoken to: Antony;
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Location: Act I, Scene 2; Comments: As made
Caesar.txt:evident here, Caesar is himself a great observer
Caesar.txt:of men. Politicians prefer men who are “fat” or
Caesar.txt:content, because those who are happy and
Caesar.txt:comfortable will not rebel.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:the capitol. There are too many bad signs and
Caesar.txt:the sighting of comets was often connected to
Caesar.txt:the death of leaders.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Location: Act II, Scene 2; Comments: Caesar
Caesar.txt:Caesar’s life. Knowing that you must die, there
Caesar.txt:is no need to spend your life fearing it.
Caesar.txt:5. Speaker: Caesar; Person spoken to: Metul-
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:lus Cimber; Location: Act III, Scene 1;
Caesar.txt:Comments: With these lines, Caesar refuses to
Caesar.txt:listen to Metellus Cimber’s pleas on behalf of
Caesar.txt:his brother. The lines boldly illustrate Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:growing arrogance.

Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:6. Speaker: Antony; Person spoken to: Caesar’s
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:dead body; Location: Act III, Scene 1; Comments: Mark Antony speaks these words over
Caesar.txt:the dead body of Julius Caesar. His grief and
Caesar.txt:anger over the death of his beloved friend move
Caesar.txt:him to seek a harsh revenge.
Caesar.txt:7.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Speaker: Antony; Persons spoken to: the
Caesar.txt:Roman people; Location: Act III, Scene 2;
Caesar.txt:Comments: In his funeral speech, Antony
Caesar.txt:moves the crowd to rage and fury by playing
Caesar.txt:on their greed and sympathy. Here, he shows
Caesar.txt:the bleeding and butchered body of Caesar to
Caesar.txt:the crowds, hoping to rouse their anger
Caesar.txt:towards Brutus.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:8. Speaker: Brutus; Person spoken to: Cassius;
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Location: Act IV, Scene 3; Comments: Brutus
Caesar.txt:and Cassius are discussing the next military
Caesar.txt:moves they are to make against Antony and
Caesar.txt:Octavius. Cassius has suggested that they stay
Caesar.txt:put and wait for their enemies to come to
Caesar.txt:them. Brutus vetoes Cassius’ idea and asserts
Caesar.txt:that the time to move is now. Again, Brutus
Caesar.txt:makes the wrong decision while Cassius gives
Caesar.txt:in to the whims of his friend.
Caesar.txt:9. Speaker: Brutus; Person spoken to: the spirit of
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Caesar; Location: Act V, Scene 3; Comments:
Caesar.txt:Brutus discovers the body of Cassius. Brutus
Caesar.txt:realizes that even though Caesar’s body is dead,
Caesar.txt:his spirit continues to exert an incredible influence over life and events.
Caesar.txt:10. Speaker: Antony; Location: Act V, Scene 5;
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Comments: Antony eulogizes over the body of
Caesar.txt:Brutus. Are the words spoken sarcastically as
Caesar.txt:they were in Caesar’s oration? Or does Antony
Caesar.txt:say what needs to be heard to bring peace and
Caesar.txt:unity to Rome?

Caesar.txt:CLIFFSCOMPLETE READING
Caesar.txt:GROUP DISCUSSION GUIDE
Caesar.txt:Use the following questions and topics to enhance
Caesar.txt:your reading group discussions. The discussion can
Caesar.txt:help get you thinking — and hopefully talking —
Caesar.txt:about Shakespeare in a whole new way!
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
Caesar.txt:1. Throughout Julius Caesar, you can view many
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:of the characters’ actions as influenced by
Caesar.txt:choice (or free will ), influenced by fate (or destiny), or influenced by supernatural forces.
Caesar.txt:Which of Brutus’ actions seem to come from
Caesar.txt:free will? Which seem to come from destiny?
Caesar.txt:What actions seem influenced by supernatural
Caesar.txt:forces? What about the actions of Caesar? Cassius? Antony? What relationship between free
Caesar.txt:will, destiny, and supernatural forces does
Caesar.txt:Shakespeare suggest?
Caesar.txt:2. Julius Caesar features a large cast of supporting
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:characters. Why did Shakespeare include the
Caesar.txt:different if you took away each of these
Caesar.txt:characters?
Caesar.txt:3. If you were producing a new stage or film ver-
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:sion of Julius Caesar, how would you cast the
Caesar.txt:role of Julius Caesar? Should the actor playing
Caesar.txt:this role be older (in his 60s or 70s) and weary?
Caesar.txt:Or middle-aged and still energetic and spry?
Caesar.txt:How would you costume him? Does his costume make him look out-of-shape or robust?
Caesar.txt:How does the casting and costuming of Caesar affect the meaning of the entire play?
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:4. Although many members of Shakespeare’s orig-
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:inal audience believed in supernatural forces,
Caesar.txt:far fewer modern audience members do. In
Caesar.txt:fact, some recent productions of Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:have cut all supernatural elements (the soothsayer, the storm before Caesar’s murder, and so
Caesar.txt:on) from the play in an effort to focus the
Caesar.txt:drama on the changes within the characters’
Caesar.txt:minds. Are the supernatural elements in the
Caesar.txt:play necessary for a modern audience? What
Caesar.txt:are the benefits of cutting supernatural elements from the play? What does the play lose?
Caesar.txt:5. It has been said that a good leader inspires fol-
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:lowers based on a common philosophy or
Caesar.txt:ideal, while a weak leader inspires followers
Caesar.txt:based on the leader’s charismatic personality or
Caesar.txt:personal strengths. Given this definition, how
Caesar.txt:good of a leader is Caesar? What about Brutus?
Caesar.txt:Cassius? Antony? Octavius? Which modern
Caesar.txt:political and business leaders inspire followers
Caesar.txt:to work for a common philosophy?
Caesar.txt:6. Female characters — particularly Portia and
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:secondary importance in the play, even though
Caesar.txt:many of their opinions are strong and some of
Caesar.txt:their fears become reality. Where in the play
Caesar.txt:are women taken seriously? What are the consequences of other characters disregarding their
Caesar.txt:fear and opinions? What might Shakespeare be
Caesar.txt:saying about the role of women in Roman society? In politics in general?
Caesar.txt:7. For business and political leaders, public
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:demands can often ruin personal relationships.
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:CliffsComplete Reading Group Discussion Guide
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Likewise, a leader’s personal life can affect his
Caesar.txt:or her ability to publicly lead. What personal
Caesar.txt:relationships are destroyed in Julius Caesar?
Caesar.txt:Which public images are destroyed in the play?
Caesar.txt:What might Shakespeare be saying about the
Caesar.txt:relationship between our leaders’ public and
Caesar.txt:private lives? Is a balance between public and
Caesar.txt:private life ever possible?
Caesar.txt:8. Although many of the characters and actions
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:within Julius Caesar are rooted in history, successful productions of the play have been set in
Caesar.txt:time periods and locations different from those
Caesar.txt:specified by Shakespeare in his original work.
Caesar.txt:For example, productions of Julius Caesar have
Caesar.txt:been set in Nazi Germany, a 1930s Chicago
Caesar.txt:meatpacking factory, and even in outer space.
Caesar.txt:What does the play lose when it’s set in a time
Caesar.txt:period different from its historical roots? What
Caesar.txt:does the play gain? What characters, lines, or
Caesar.txt:scenes would need to be cut or rewritten to fit
Caesar.txt:with changes in time period or location?
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:177
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:9. Because the character of Julius Caesar dies so
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:early in the play, some readers and critics have
Caesar.txt:suggested that a more appropriate title for
Caesar.txt:Julius Caesar might be Brutus. In what way is
Caesar.txt:Brutus’ story the focus of Julius Caesar? Why
Caesar.txt:might Shakespeare have chosen Julius Caesar
Caesar.txt:as the title of the play? How does Caesar influence the half of the play in which he does not
Caesar.txt:appear? Is there a better title for this play?
Caesar.txt:10. Some productions of Julius Caesar cut some of
Caesar.txt:
Caesar.txt:Antony’s and Octavius’ lines at the end of the
Caesar.txt:play. Other productions cut their final entrance
Caesar.txt:all together and end the play with Brutus’ final
Caesar.txt:speech and suicide. How important is Antony
Caesar.txt:and Octavius’ final presence to the end of Julius
Caesar.txt:Caesar? What are the pros and cons of ending
Caesar.txt:the play with Brutus’ suicide? Is the play still a
Caesar.txt:tragedy without Antony and Octavius in the
Caesar.txt:final scene?

Hamlet.txt:From the Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library
Hamlet.txt:
Hamlet.txt:It is hard to imagine a world without Shakespeare. Since their
Hamlet.txt:composition four hundred years ago, Shakespeare’s plays and poems
Hamlet.txt:have traveled the globe, inviting those who see and read his works to
Hamlet.txt:make them their own.
Hamlet.txt:Readers of the New Folger Editions are part of this ongoing process
Hamlet.txt:of “taking up Shakespeare,” finding our own thoughts and feelings in
Hamlet.txt:language that strikes us as old or unusual and, for that very reason,
Hamlet.txt:new. We still struggle to keep up with a writer who could think a mile
Hamlet.txt:a minute, whose words paint pictures that shift like clouds. These
Hamlet.txt:expertly edited texts are presented to the public as a resource for
Hamlet.txt:study, artistic adaptation, and enjoyment. By making the classic texts
Hamlet.txt:of the New Folger Editions available in electronic form as Folger
Hamlet.txt:Digital Texts, we place a trusted resource in the hands of anyone who
Hamlet.txt:wants them.
Hamlet.txt:The New Folger Editions of Shakespeare’s plays, which are the basis
Hamlet.txt:for the texts realized here in digital form, are special because of their
Hamlet.txt:origin. The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is the
Hamlet.txt:single greatest documentary source of Shakespeare’s works. An
Hamlet.txt:unparalleled collection of early modern books, manuscripts, and
Hamlet.txt:artwork connected to Shakespeare, the Folger’s holdings have been
Hamlet.txt:consulted extensively in the preparation of these texts. The Editions
Hamlet.txt:also reflect the expertise gained through the regular performance of
Hamlet.txt:Shakespeare’s works in the Folger’s Elizabethan Theater.
Hamlet.txt:I want to express my deep thanks to editors Barbara Mowat and Paul
Hamlet.txt:Werstine for creating these indispensable editions of Shakespeare’s
Hamlet.txt:works, which incorporate the best of textual scholarship with a
Hamlet.txt:richness of commentary that is both inspired and engaging. Readers
Hamlet.txt:who want to know more about Shakespeare and his plays can follow
Hamlet.txt:the paths these distinguished scholars have tread by visiting the Folger
Hamlet.txt:either in-person or online, where a range of physical and digital
Hamlet.txt:resources exists to supplement the material in these texts. I commend
Hamlet.txt:to you these words, and hope that they inspire.
Hamlet.txt:Michael Witmore
Hamlet.txt:Director, Folger Shakespeare Library

Hamlet.txt:Textual Introduction
Hamlet.txt:By Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine
Hamlet.txt:Until now, with the release of the Folger Digital Texts, readers in
Hamlet.txt:search of a free online text of Shakespeare’s plays had to be content
Hamlet.txt:primarily with using the Moby™ Text, which reproduces a latenineteenth century version of the plays. What is the difference? Many
Hamlet.txt:ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what
Hamlet.txt:Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare’s plays were not published the
Hamlet.txt:way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single,
Hamlet.txt:authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in
Hamlet.txt:multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and
Hamlet.txt:by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called
Hamlet.txt:the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different
Hamlet.txt:versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet,
Hamlet.txt:and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and
Hamlet.txt:then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the
Hamlet.txt:other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more
Hamlet.txt:accurate text.
Hamlet.txt:Other editorial decisions involve choices about whether an unfamiliar
Hamlet.txt:word could be understood in light of other writings of the period or
Hamlet.txt:whether it should be changed; decisions about words that made it into
Hamlet.txt:Shakespeare’s text by accident through four hundred years of
Hamlet.txt:printings and misprinting; and even decisions based on cultural
Hamlet.txt:preference and taste. When the Moby™ Text was created, for
Hamlet.txt:example, it was deemed “improper” and “indecent” for Miranda to
Hamlet.txt:chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest,
Hamlet.txt:1.2: “Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not
Hamlet.txt:take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee…”). All Shakespeare
Hamlet.txt:editors at the time took the speech away from her and gave it to her
Hamlet.txt:father, Prospero.
Hamlet.txt:The editors of the Moby™ Shakespeare produced their text long
Hamlet.txt:before scholars fully understood the proper grounds on which to make
Hamlet.txt:the thousands of decisions that Shakespeare editors face. The Folger
Hamlet.txt:Library Shakespeare Editions, on which the Folger Digital Texts
Hamlet.txt:depend, make this editorial process as nearly transparent as is
Hamlet.txt:possible, in contrast to older texts, like the Moby™, which hide
Hamlet.txt:editorial interventions. The reader of the Folger Shakespeare knows
Hamlet.txt:where the text has been altered because editorial interventions are
Hamlet.txt:signaled by square brackets (for example, from Othello: “ If she in
Hamlet.txt:
Hamlet.txt:chains of magic were not bound, ”), half-square brackets (for
Hamlet.txt:example, from Henry V: “With blood and sword and fire to win your
Hamlet.txt:right,”), or angle brackets (for example, from Hamlet: “O farewell,
Hamlet.txt:honest soldier. Who hath relieved/you?”). At any point in the text,
Hamlet.txt:you can hover your cursor over a bracket for more information.
Hamlet.txt:Because the Folger Digital Texts are edited in accord with twenty-first
Hamlet.txt:century knowledge about Shakespeare’s texts, the Folger here
Hamlet.txt:provides them to readers, scholars, teachers, actors, directors, and
Hamlet.txt:students, free of charge, confident of their quality as texts of the plays
Hamlet.txt:and pleased to be able to make this contribution to the study and
Hamlet.txt:enjoyment of Shakespeare.
Hamlet.txt:
Hamlet.txt:Synopsis
Hamlet.txt:Events before the start of Hamlet set the stage for tragedy. When the
Hamlet.txt:king of Denmark, Prince Hamlet’s father, suddenly dies, Hamlet’s
Hamlet.txt:mother, Gertrude, marries his uncle Claudius, who becomes the new
Hamlet.txt:king.
Hamlet.txt:A spirit who claims to be the ghost of Hamlet’s father describes his
Hamlet.txt:murder at the hands of Claudius and demands that Hamlet avenge the
Hamlet.txt:killing. When the councilor Polonius learns from his daughter,
Hamlet.txt:Ophelia, that Hamlet has visited her in an apparently distracted state,
Hamlet.txt:Polonius attributes the prince’s condition to lovesickness, and he sets
Hamlet.txt:a trap for Hamlet using Ophelia as bait.
Hamlet.txt:To confirm Claudius’s guilt, Hamlet arranges for a play that mimics
Hamlet.txt:the murder; Claudius’s reaction is that of a guilty man. Hamlet, now
Hamlet.txt:free to act, mistakenly kills Polonius, thinking he is Claudius.
Hamlet.txt:Claudius sends Hamlet away as part of a deadly plot.
Hamlet.txt:After Polonius’s death, Ophelia goes mad and later drowns. Hamlet,
Hamlet.txt:who has returned safely to confront the king, agrees to a fencing
Hamlet.txt:match with Ophelia’s brother, Laertes, who secretly poisons his own
Hamlet.txt:rapier. At the match, Claudius prepares poisoned wine for Hamlet,
Hamlet.txt:which Gertrude unknowingly drinks; as she dies, she accuses
Hamlet.txt:Claudius, whom Hamlet kills. Then first Laertes and then Hamlet die,
Hamlet.txt:both victims of Laertes’ rapier.

Hamlet.txt:(As I perceived it, I must tell you that,

Hamlet.txt:Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
Hamlet.txt:If I had played the desk or table-book
Hamlet.txt:Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Hamlet.txt:Or looked upon this love with idle sight?
Hamlet.txt:What might you think? No, I went round to work,
Hamlet.txt:And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
Hamlet.txt:“Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.
Hamlet.txt:This must not be.” And then I prescripts gave her,
Hamlet.txt:That she should lock herself from his resort,
Hamlet.txt:Admit no messengers, receive no tokens;
Hamlet.txt:Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
Hamlet.txt:And he, repelled (a short tale to make),

Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS Not I, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS Honest, my lord?
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Ay, sir. To be honest, as this world goes, is to
Hamlet.txt:be one man picked out of ten thousand.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS That’s very true, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead
Hamlet.txt:dog, being a good kissing carrion—Have you a
Hamlet.txt:daughter?
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS I have, my lord.

Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Words, words, words.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS What is the matter, my lord?
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Between who?
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Slanders, sir; for the satirical rogue says here
Hamlet.txt:that old men have gray beards, that their faces are
Hamlet.txt:wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
Hamlet.txt:plum-tree gum, and that they have a plentiful lack of
Hamlet.txt:wit, together with most weak hams; all which, sir,
Hamlet.txt:though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I
Hamlet.txt:hold it not honesty to have it thus set down; for
Hamlet.txt:yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if, like a crab,
Hamlet.txt:you could go backward.

Hamlet.txt:have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of
Hamlet.txt:Fortune that she sends you to prison hither?
Hamlet.txt:GUILDENSTERN Prison, my lord?
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Denmark’s a prison.
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET A goodly one, in which there are many confines,
Hamlet.txt:wards, and dungeons, Denmark being one o’
Hamlet.txt:th’ worst.
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ We think not so, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Why, then, ’tis none to you, for there is
Hamlet.txt:nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it
Hamlet.txt:so. To me, it is a prison.
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ Why, then, your ambition makes it one.
Hamlet.txt:’Tis too narrow for your mind.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and
Hamlet.txt:count myself a king of infinite space, were it not
Hamlet.txt:that I have bad dreams.
Hamlet.txt:GUILDENSTERN Which dreams, indeed, are ambition,
Hamlet.txt:for the very substance of the ambitious is merely
Hamlet.txt:the shadow of a dream.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow.
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy
Hamlet.txt:and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs
Hamlet.txt:and outstretched heroes the beggars’ shadows.
Hamlet.txt:Shall we to th’ court? For, by my fay, I cannot
Hamlet.txt:reason.
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ/GUILDENSTERN We’ll wait upon you.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET No such matter. I will not sort you with the
Hamlet.txt:rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an
Hamlet.txt:honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,
Hamlet.txt:in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at

Hamlet.txt:wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all

Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did
Hamlet.txt:when I was in the city? Are they so followed?
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ No, indeed are they not.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET How comes it? Do they grow rusty?
Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ Nay, their endeavor keeps in the wonted
Hamlet.txt:pace. But there is, sir, an aerie of children, little

Hamlet.txt:HAMLET My lord, I have news to tell you: when Roscius
Hamlet.txt:was an actor in Rome—
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS The actors are come hither, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Buzz, buzz.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS Upon my honor—
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS The best actors in the world, either for
Hamlet.txt:tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
Hamlet.txt:historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,
Hamlet.txt:tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or

Hamlet.txt:FIRST PLAYER What speech, my good lord?
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it
Hamlet.txt:was never acted, or, if it was, not above once; for
Hamlet.txt:the play, I remember, pleased not the million:
Hamlet.txt:’twas caviary to the general. But it was (as I

Hamlet.txt:The rugged Pyrrhus, like th’ Hyrcanian beast—
Hamlet.txt:’tis not so; it begins with Pyrrhus:
Hamlet.txt:The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Hamlet.txt:Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
Hamlet.txt:When he lay couchèd in th’ ominous horse,
Hamlet.txt:Hath now this dread and black complexion smeared
Hamlet.txt:With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot,
Hamlet.txt:Now is he total gules, horridly tricked
Hamlet.txt:With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Hamlet.txt:Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
Hamlet.txt:That lend a tyrannous and a damnèd light
Hamlet.txt:To their lord’s murder. Roasted in wrath and fire,
Hamlet.txt:And thus o’ersizèd with coagulate gore,
Hamlet.txt:With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Hamlet.txt:Old grandsire Priam seeks.
Hamlet.txt:So, proceed you.
Hamlet.txt:POLONIUS ’Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good
Hamlet.txt:accent and good discretion.
Hamlet.txt:Anon he finds him
Hamlet.txt:FIRST PLAYER
Hamlet.txt:Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
Hamlet.txt:Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Hamlet.txt:Repugnant to command. Unequal matched,
Hamlet.txt:Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
Hamlet.txt:But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
Hamlet.txt:Th’ unnervèd father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Hamlet.txt:Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Hamlet.txt:Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Hamlet.txt:Takes prisoner Pyrrhus’ ear. For lo, his sword,
Hamlet.txt:Which was declining on the milky head
Hamlet.txt:Of reverend Priam, seemed i’ th’ air to stick.

Hamlet.txt:Now I am alone.
Hamlet.txt:O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Hamlet.txt:Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Hamlet.txt:But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Hamlet.txt:Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Hamlet.txt:That from her working all his visage wanned,
Hamlet.txt:Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect,
Hamlet.txt:A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
Hamlet.txt:With forms to his conceit—and all for nothing!
Hamlet.txt:For Hecuba!
Hamlet.txt:What’s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
Hamlet.txt:That he should weep for her? What would he do
Hamlet.txt:Had he the motive and the cue for passion
Hamlet.txt:That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
Hamlet.txt:And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Hamlet.txt:Make mad the guilty and appall the free,
Hamlet.txt:Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed
Hamlet.txt:The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
Hamlet.txt:A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak
Hamlet.txt:Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Hamlet.txt:And can say nothing—no, not for a king
Hamlet.txt:Upon whose property and most dear life
Hamlet.txt:A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Hamlet.txt:Who calls me “villain”? breaks my pate across?
Hamlet.txt:Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Hamlet.txt:Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i’ th’ throat
Hamlet.txt:As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?
Hamlet.txt:Ha! ’Swounds, I should take it! For it cannot be
Hamlet.txt:But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall
Hamlet.txt:To make oppression bitter, or ere this
Hamlet.txt:I should have fatted all the region kites
Hamlet.txt:With this slave’s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!

Hamlet.txt:That I, the son of a dear father murdered,
Hamlet.txt:Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,

Hamlet.txt:That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Hamlet.txt:Have, by the very cunning of the scene,
Hamlet.txt:Been struck so to the soul that presently
Hamlet.txt:They have proclaimed their malefactions;
Hamlet.txt:For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
Hamlet.txt:With most miraculous organ. I’ll have these players
Hamlet.txt:Play something like the murder of my father
Hamlet.txt:Before mine uncle. I’ll observe his looks;
Hamlet.txt:I’ll tent him to the quick. If he do blench,
Hamlet.txt:I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
Hamlet.txt:May be a devil, and the devil hath power
Hamlet.txt:T’ assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps,
Hamlet.txt:Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
Hamlet.txt:As he is very potent with such spirits,
Hamlet.txt:Abuses me to damn me. I’ll have grounds

Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Be not too tame neither, but let your own

Hamlet.txt:I do believe you think what now you speak,
Hamlet.txt:But what we do determine oft we break.
Hamlet.txt:Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Hamlet.txt:Of violent birth, but poor validity,
Hamlet.txt:Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree
Hamlet.txt:But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
Hamlet.txt:Most necessary ’tis that we forget
Hamlet.txt:To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
Hamlet.txt:What to ourselves in passion we propose,
Hamlet.txt:The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
Hamlet.txt:The violence of either grief or joy
Hamlet.txt:Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
Hamlet.txt:Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Hamlet.txt:Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
Hamlet.txt:This world is not for aye, nor ’tis not strange
Hamlet.txt:That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
Hamlet.txt:For ’tis a question left us yet to prove
Hamlet.txt:Whether love lead fortune or else fortune love.
Hamlet.txt:The great man down, you mark his favorite flies;
Hamlet.txt:The poor, advanced, makes friends of enemies.
Hamlet.txt:And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
Hamlet.txt:For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
Hamlet.txt:And who in want a hollow friend doth try
Hamlet.txt:Directly seasons him his enemy.
Hamlet.txt:But, orderly to end where I begun:
Hamlet.txt:Our wills and fates do so contrary run
Hamlet.txt:That our devices still are overthrown;
Hamlet.txt:Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
Hamlet.txt:So think thou wilt no second husband wed,
Hamlet.txt:But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Hamlet.txt:HAMLET You are welcome.
Hamlet.txt:GUILDENSTERN Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not

Hamlet.txt:ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord, what is your cause of

Hamlet.txt:
Hamlet.txt:for your dull ass will not mend his pace with
Hamlet.txt:beating. And, when you are asked this question
Hamlet.txt:next, say “a grave-maker.” The houses he makes
Hamlet.txt:lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in, and fetch me a
Hamlet.txt:stoup of liquor.
Hamlet.txt:The Other Man exits
Hamlet.txt:and the Gravedigger digs and sings.
Hamlet.txt:In youth when I did love, did love,
Hamlet.txt:Methought it was very sweet
Hamlet.txt:To contract—O—the time for—a—my behove,
Hamlet.txt:O, methought there—a—was nothing—a—meet.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Has this fellow no feeling of his business? He
Hamlet.txt:sings in grave-making.
Hamlet.txt:HORATIO Custom hath made it in him a property of
Hamlet.txt:easiness.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET ’Tis e’en so. The hand of little employment
Hamlet.txt:hath the daintier sense.
Hamlet.txt:GRAVEDIGGER sings
Hamlet.txt:But age with his stealing steps
Hamlet.txt:Hath clawed me in his clutch,
Hamlet.txt:And hath shipped me into the land,
Hamlet.txt:As if I had never been such.
Hamlet.txt:He digs up a skull.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET That skull had a tongue in it and could sing
Hamlet.txt:once. How the knave jowls it to the ground as if
Hamlet.txt:’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder!
Hamlet.txt:This might be the pate of a politician which this ass
Hamlet.txt:now o’erreaches, one that would circumvent God,
Hamlet.txt:might it not?
Hamlet.txt:HORATIO It might, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Or of a courtier, which could say “Good
Hamlet.txt:morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?”
Hamlet.txt:This might be my Lord Such-a-one that praised my
Hamlet.txt:Lord Such-a-one’s horse when he went to beg it,

Hamlet.txt:chapless and knocked about the mazard with a

Hamlet.txt:He digs up more skulls.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET There’s another. Why may not that be the

Hamlet.txt:does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him
Hamlet.txt:about the sconce with a dirty shovel and will not tell
Hamlet.txt:him of his action of battery? Hum, this fellow might
Hamlet.txt:be in ’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
Hamlet.txt:his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
Hamlet.txt:his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines and the
Hamlet.txt:recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full
Hamlet.txt:of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more
Hamlet.txt:of his purchases, and double ones too, than the
Hamlet.txt:length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very

Hamlet.txt:HORATIO Not a jot more, my lord.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Hamlet.txt:HORATIO Ay, my lord, and of calves’ skins too.

Hamlet.txt:galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been
Hamlet.txt:grave-maker?
Hamlet.txt:GRAVEDIGGER
Hamlet.txt:Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to ’t
Hamlet.txt:that day that our last King Hamlet overcame
Hamlet.txt:Fortinbras.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET How long is that since?
Hamlet.txt:Cannot you tell that? Every fool can
Hamlet.txt:GRAVEDIGGER
Hamlet.txt:tell that. It was that very day that young Hamlet
Hamlet.txt:was born—he that is mad, and sent into England.
Hamlet.txt:HAMLET Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Hamlet.txt:Why, because he was mad. He shall
Hamlet.txt:GRAVEDIGGER

Hamlet.txt:This quarry cries on havoc. O proud Death,
Hamlet.txt:What feast is toward in thine eternal cell
Hamlet.txt:That thou so many princes at a shot
Hamlet.txt:So bloodily hast struck?
Hamlet.txt:AMBASSADOR
Hamlet.txt:The sight is dismal,
Hamlet.txt:And our affairs from England come too late.
Hamlet.txt:The ears are senseless that should give us hearing
Hamlet.txt:To tell him his commandment is fulfilled,
Hamlet.txt:That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Hamlet.txt:Where should we have our thanks?
Hamlet.txt:HORATIO
Hamlet.txt:Not from his
Hamlet.txt:mouth,
Hamlet.txt:Had it th’ ability of life to thank you.
Hamlet.txt:He never gave commandment for their death.
Hamlet.txt:But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
Hamlet.txt:You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Hamlet.txt:Are here arrived, give order that these bodies
Hamlet.txt:High on a stage be placed to the view,
Hamlet.txt:And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world
Hamlet.txt:How these things came about. So shall you hear
Hamlet.txt:Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Hamlet.txt:Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Hamlet.txt:Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
Hamlet.txt:And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Hamlet.txt:Fall’n on th’ inventors’ heads. All this can I
Hamlet.txt:Truly deliver.
Hamlet.txt:FORTINBRAS
Hamlet.txt:Let us haste to hear it
Hamlet.txt:And call the noblest to the audience.

Macbeth.txt:About The Author
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Warren King has been teaching English literature for thirty-five years in English
Macbeth.txt:comprehensive and public schools.
Macbeth.txt:During the 1980's he was seconded to the national Shakespeare and Schools
Macbeth.txt:project to help develop methods of teaching Shakespeare in the classroom to bring
Macbeth.txt:the plays to life for pupils of all ages. After the project ended he continued that work
Macbeth.txt:as an adviser in to a London Education Authority, where he worked with teachers in
Macbeth.txt:creating Shakespeare projects in schools and helping English teachers, both
Macbeth.txt:primary and secondary, to make Shakespeare lively, comprehensible and enjoyable
Macbeth.txt:for their pupils.
Macbeth.txt:He has created and conducted workshops in Shakespeare for both teachers and
Macbeth.txt:students, visiting schools around the UK and continental Europe.
Macbeth.txt:As well as producing several books about the teaching of Shakespeare and writing
Macbeth.txt:articles for educational journals, Warren regularly addresses groups of teachers,
Macbeth.txt:showing them ways of developing GCSE, Key Stage 3 and A Level Shakespeare
Macbeth.txt:resources.
Macbeth.txt:These modern English Shakespeare novelizations stem from his realisation that
Macbeth.txt:although so much good work has been done on textual aspects and the broad
Macbeth.txt:grasp of plot, little has been done about resources that would give students a
Macbeth.txt:complete grasp of the complexity of a whole Shakespeare text in one short reading.

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene One
Macbeth.txt:Somewhere and nowhere. A terrifying storm. Lightning, with blinding white
Macbeth.txt:glimpses of a weird landscape. Each flash gives birth to an earth-shaking crack of
Macbeth.txt:thunder. Out of the darkness three voices wail.
Macbeth.txt:‘When shall we three meet again,
Macbeth.txt:In thunder, lightning or in rain?’
Macbeth.txt:‘When the hurleyburley's done,
Macbeth.txt:When the battle's lost and won.’
Macbeth.txt:‘That will be ere the set of sun.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Where the place?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Upon the heath.’
Macbeth.txt:‘There to meet with Macbeth.’
Macbeth.txt:A cacophany of bloodcurdling yelps and inhuman screams, cutting through the
Macbeth.txt:noise of the storm.
Macbeth.txt:‘I come, Graymalkin!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Paddock calls.’
Macbeth.txt:Lightning momentarily reveals three deformed shapes linking hands in a
Macbeth.txt:grotesque dance.
Macbeth.txt:‘Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Macbeth.txt:Hover through the fog and filthy air.’
Macbeth.txt:A mighty crash of thunder, a terrifying whiteness, then darkness and silence.

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Two
Macbeth.txt:Duncan, King of Scotland, was conferring with his sons, Malcolm and
Macbeth.txt:Donalbain, at a fortress near Forres. Matters could not be worse. The rebels, led by
Macbeth.txt:the northern Thane, Macdonwald, had made an alliance with the Norwegian king
Macbeth.txt:and the two forces were preparing to roll across Scotland like a tidal wave.
Macbeth.txt:Two sentries brought a limping, bleeding soldier to the King. The man clutched
Macbeth.txt:his torn side, resisting an overwhelming desire to pass into unconsciousness. It was
Macbeth.txt:clear that he had something important to tell the King.
Macbeth.txt:‘What bloody man is this?’ said Duncan. ‘I can see he's just come from the
Macbeth.txt:battlefield so he'll be able to give us the latest news.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Ah!’ exclaimed Malcolm. ‘This is the sergeant who struggled so valiantly to
Macbeth.txt:save me from captivity. Hello, brave friend. Tell the King how things stand.’
Macbeth.txt:The man winced. His breathing was laboured but his eyes shone. ‘It was on a
Macbeth.txt:knife-edge,’ he said. ‘The armies were like two spent swimmers clinging together to
Macbeth.txt:prevent themselves from drowning. Then the merciless Macdonwald -’ the sergeant
Macbeth.txt:spat with disgust - ‘that most vile of men! - brought in some reinforcements from the
Macbeth.txt:western isles. After that fortune began smiling on him.’
Macbeth.txt:Duncan and his sons exchanged glances. Lennox, a close ally of the King,
Macbeth.txt:was there too. Their faces expressed the seriousness of the situation.
Macbeth.txt:‘But it was all in vain,’ continued the sergeant. He tried a smile and winced
Macbeth.txt:again. ‘Because brave Macbeth - how well he deserves that name! - disregarding
Macbeth.txt:his own safety, brandishing his sword, which smoked with hot blood, carved his way
Macbeth.txt:through the troops until he faced the cursed rebel. He didn't stop - no handshakes
Macbeth.txt:or farewells - until he had unseamed him from the navel to the jaw and fixed his
Macbeth.txt:head on our battlements.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh!’ exclaimed Duncan. ‘Valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!’
Macbeth.txt:‘But it wasn't over yet,’ said the sergeant. ‘Can you believe this, King of
Macbeth.txt:Scotland? No sooner had the western islanders taken to their heels than the
Macbeth.txt:Norwegian tried again. Armed with reinforcements he began a fresh assault.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Didn't that dismay our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?’ said the King.
Macbeth.txt:The sergeant attempted a laugh. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘As much as sparrows dismay
Macbeth.txt:eagles or hares lions. If I'm completely honest I'd say they were like overworked
Macbeth.txt:guns, their barrels exploding, as they lay into the enemy.’ He slipped to the ground.
Macbeth.txt:‘I'm weak, I need help.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You've done well,’ said Duncan. He turned to an attendant. ‘Go, get him to a
Macbeth.txt:doctor.’
Macbeth.txt:As the sentries carried the sergeant out another newcomer, even fresher from
Macbeth.txt:the battlefield, arrived.
Macbeth.txt:‘It's the worthy Thane of Ross!’ said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘And in a hurry,’ said Lennox. ‘Bursting to tell us something.’

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘God save the King!’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘Where have you come from, worthy Thane?’ said Duncan.
Macbeth.txt:‘From Fife, great King,’ said Ross. ‘Where Norwegian banners have been
Macbeth.txt:flying freely. Norway himself, with the help of that most disloyal of traitors, the
Macbeth.txt:Thane of Cawdor, began a terrible assault. Until Macbeth, absolutely fearless,
Macbeth.txt:confronted him head on and, matching him point for point, blow for blow, ground
Macbeth.txt:him down and, to conclude -’ Ross grinned. ‘The victory fell on us.’
Macbeth.txt:Duncan spun round and beamed at his council. ‘Great happiness!’ he said and
Macbeth.txt:clapped his hands.
Macbeth.txt:‘So now,’ said Ross, ‘Sweno's in disarray. ‘And we didn't even allow him to
Macbeth.txt:bury his men until he had paid us ten thousand dollars.’
Macbeth.txt:‘That Thane of Cawdor won't have a chance of deceiving us again,’ said
Macbeth.txt:Duncan. He placed his hand on Ross' shoulder. ‘Go and see to his immediate
Macbeth.txt:execution and with his former title greet Macbeth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'll take care of it,’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘What he has lost the noble Macbeth has won,’ said Duncan.

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Three
Macbeth.txt:It was beginning to grow dark. Thunder rumbled and the heath was covered
Macbeth.txt:with mud. Three deformed shapes crept out of the slime.
Macbeth.txt:‘Where hast thou been, sister?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Killing swine.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Sister, where thou?’
Macbeth.txt:‘A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
Macbeth.txt:And munched, and munched, and munched:
Macbeth.txt:'Give me,' quoth I:
Macbeth.txt:'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Macbeth.txt:Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
Macbeth.txt:But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
Macbeth.txt:And, like a rat without a tail,
Macbeth.txt:I'll do, I'll do and I'll do!’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'll give thee a wind.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Thou'rt kind.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And I another.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I myself have all the other;
Macbeth.txt:And the very ports they blow,
Macbeth.txt:All the quarters that they know
Macbeth.txt:In the shipman's card.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'll drain him dry as hay:
Macbeth.txt:Sleep shall neither night nor day
Macbeth.txt:Hang upon his pent-house lid;
Macbeth.txt:He shall live a man forbid.
Macbeth.txt:Weary se'nnights nine times nine
Macbeth.txt:Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
Macbeth.txt:Though his bark cannot be lost,
Macbeth.txt:Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
Macbeth.txt:Look what I have.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Show me, show me!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Here I have a pilot's thumb,
Macbeth.txt:Wracked as homeward he did come.’
Macbeth.txt:A drumbeat, marking the progress of an army on the march, could be heard
Macbeth.txt:approaching.
Macbeth.txt:‘A drum! a drum! Macbeth doth come.’
Macbeth.txt:The three joined hands and began moving slowly in a circle.

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘The weird sisters, hand in hand,
Macbeth.txt:Posters of the sea and land,
Macbeth.txt:Thus do go about, about:
Macbeth.txt:Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
Macbeth.txt:And thrice again, to make up nine.
Macbeth.txt:Peace! The charm's wound up.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth and Banquo walked ahead of their troops.
Macbeth.txt:‘What a day,’ said Macbeth. ‘Victory and filthy weather. I've never seen so fair
Macbeth.txt:and foul a day.’
Macbeth.txt:‘How far is it to Forres?’ said Banquo. He stopped short as three human
Macbeth.txt:shapes rose in front of them. ‘What are these?’ he said. ‘So withered and strangely
Macbeth.txt:dressed that they don't look like anything that lives on the earth.’ He shut his eyes
Macbeth.txt:tight then opened them again. ‘But they are definitely on it.’ He took a step towards
Macbeth.txt:them. ‘Are you living creatures? Or something that we should fear?’
Macbeth.txt:The three women cackled hysterically then hopped about saying 'shhh' and
Macbeth.txt:placing their bony fingers on their skinny lips.
Macbeth.txt:‘You seem to be women but your beards cast doubt even on that,’ said
Macbeth.txt:Banquo.
Macbeth.txt:‘Speak if you can,’ said Macbeth. ‘What are you?’
Macbeth.txt:‘All hail, Macbeth!’ cawed the first witch. ‘Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth and Banquo glanced at each other.
Macbeth.txt:‘All hail, Macbeth,’ screamed the second witch. ‘Hail to thee, Thane of
Macbeth.txt:Cawdor!’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth laughed nervously. Banquo stared at the women.
Macbeth.txt:‘All hail Macbeth!’ cooed the third witch. ‘That shalt be king hereafter!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Good Sir,’ said Banquo as Macbeth recoiled. ‘Why do you start and seem to
Macbeth.txt:be afraid of things that sound so favourable?’ He turned back to the three creatures
Macbeth.txt:‘Are you real or what? Who are you? You greet my partner showing knowledge of
Macbeth.txt:who he is and promise him great things, including the hope of royalty - which makes
Macbeth.txt:him speechless. You don't say anything to me. If you can look into the future and
Macbeth.txt:tell who will prosper and who won't, speak to me then.’
Macbeth.txt:They looked up slowly, their eyes boring into him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hail,’ said the first, somberly.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hail,’ said the second.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hail,’ said the third.
Macbeth.txt:There was a pause. When the first witch spoke again her voice was like iced
Macbeth.txt:water.
Macbeth.txt:‘Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.’
Macbeth.txt:The second witch shook her head slowly. Her voice was low and snake-like.
Macbeth.txt:‘Not so happy, yet much happier.’

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:The third witch pointed at him. ‘Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. So,
Macbeth.txt:all hail, Macbeth and Banquo.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!’ said the first witch. They glided backwards and
Macbeth.txt:began merging with the gloom.
Macbeth.txt:‘Stop!’ said Macbeth. ‘Is that all? Tell me more. I know I'm Thane of Glamis as
Macbeth.txt:a result of Sinel's death. But Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor is alive and well. And
Macbeth.txt:as for being king! It's no more believable than being Thane of Cawdor. Tell me
Macbeth.txt:where you get this strange information. Or why you stop us on this blasted heath
Macbeth.txt:with such a prophetic greeting. Speak up, I command you!’
Macbeth.txt:They had gone.
Macbeth.txt:‘These are bubbles of the earth,’ said Banquo. ‘Where have they gone?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Vanished into the air. And what seemed solid melted like breath in the wind. I
Macbeth.txt:wish they had stayed.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Were we seeing things?’ said Banquo. ‘Have we gone mad?’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth gazed at his friend for a moment then he laughed. ‘Your children will
Macbeth.txt:be kings.’ He doubled over and roared. Banquo began laughing too.
Macbeth.txt:‘And you'll be king,’ he said, slapping Macbeth on the back.
Macbeth.txt:‘That's not all. Thane of Cawdor too. Isn't that how the song it went?’
Macbeth.txt:‘That very tune,’ said Banquo. ‘And the words too.’
Macbeth.txt:They heard someone coming and two shapes - men on horseback - emerged
Macbeth.txt:from the darkness.
Macbeth.txt:‘Who's that?’ said Banquo.
Macbeth.txt:The two men dismounted and showed themselves to be Ross and Angus.
Macbeth.txt:After warm greetings and hearty handshakes Ross addressed Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘The King is delighted with the news of your success,’ he said. ‘He's especially
Macbeth.txt:impressed with your courageous rampage among the formidable Norwegian ranks.
Macbeth.txt:Reports about you came thick as hail and everyone raved about you.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He's sent us to thank you,’ said Angus. ‘And to escort you to him.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He's going to reward you,’ said Ross. ‘And for a start he's told me to address
Macbeth.txt:you as Thane of Cawdor. And so - ‘ He bowed. ‘Hail, most worthy Thane, for that's
Macbeth.txt:your title.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth drew in his breath.
Macbeth.txt:‘What!’ exclaimed Banquo. ‘Can the Devil speak the truth?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The Thane of Cawdor is alive,’ said Macbeth. ‘Why do you dress me in
Macbeth.txt:borrowed clothes?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The man who was the Thane is alive,’ said Angus. ‘But he's under a heavy
Macbeth.txt:death sentence. What he was up to I don't know exactly but he's committed capital
Macbeth.txt:treasons:
Macbeth.txt:that's been proved and he's confessed. So that's the end of him.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth reflected on what had happened. Glamis and Cawdor, they had said.
Macbeth.txt:Two thirds of the weird women’s words had already proved true! ‘Thanks for your
Macbeth.txt:trouble,’ he said. He leant over to Banquo and spoke softly in his ear. ‘Don't you
Macbeth.txt:have hope that your children will be kings?’

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘If you follow that to its logical conclusion it might yet bring you the crown in
Macbeth.txt:addition to Thane of Cawdor,’ said Banquo. ‘But this is very strange: sometimes, to
Macbeth.txt:bring us to destruction, the forces of darkness tell us truths - convince us with
Macbeth.txt:simple facts, to betray us in more serious matters.’
Macbeth.txt:Ross and Angus were talking quietly a few yards away. Banquo looked
Macbeth.txt:towards them. ‘Cousins,’ he said. ‘A word.’ He patted Macbeth's arm then left him.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth was immersed in confusion. What did it mean? He tried to apply
Macbeth.txt:reason to it. The weird women had told him two truths as innocent prologues to the
Macbeth.txt:imperial theme. This couldn't be bad. Nor could it be good. If it was bad why did it
Macbeth.txt:promise such success for him, beginning with an indisputable fact? He was Thane
Macbeth.txt:of Cawdor after all. But if it was good, why did it make him think about doing
Macbeth.txt:something so unnatural that it made his hair stand up on end and his heart pound
Macbeth.txt:furiously - knocking against his ribs? His worst moments of fear in battle were
Macbeth.txt:nothing to the horrors of his imagination now. The thought that kept coming to him
Macbeth.txt:was so outrageous, so unsettling, that he was losing all sense of reality.
Macbeth.txt:Banquo whistled. Macbeth glanced up: they were watching him and laughing.
Macbeth.txt:‘Look at him, said Banquo. ‘Wrapt in thought.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth smiled at them. But his mind was still full. If it was his fate to be king
Macbeth.txt:then Fate would make him king without his having to lift a finger.
Macbeth.txt:‘He's having difficulty with his new honours,’ said Banquo. ‘Which are like new
Macbeth.txt:clothes that don't really fit till we've worn them for a while.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth snapped out of it. Come what may, matters would run their course.
Macbeth.txt:‘Come on, Macbeth,’ said Banquo. ‘We're waiting for you.
Macbeth.txt:‘Forgive me,’ said Macbeth, hurrying towards them. ‘My exhausted brain was
Macbeth.txt:full of battle details. Gentlemen, I won't forget the trouble you've taken.’
Macbeth.txt:A young groom stood waiting with horses, which the two captains now
Macbeth.txt:mounted.
Macbeth.txt:‘Let's go,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Before galloping off Macbeth went up close to Banquo. ‘Think about what's
Macbeth.txt:happened,’ he said, ‘and when we've got more time to ourselves, when we've
Macbeth.txt:weighed it all up, we'll discuss it again. But let's drop it now. Come friends.’

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Four
Macbeth.txt:Has Cawdor been executed yet?’ said Duncan. ‘Haven't those I sent to do it
Macbeth.txt:returned?’
Macbeth.txt:‘My Liege, they haven't,’ said Malcolm. ‘But I've spoken to someone who
Macbeth.txt:witnessed it. He said the traitor confessed his treasons very frankly: he implored
Macbeth.txt:your Highness' pardon. He was deeply repentant. Nothing he ever did in his life was
Macbeth.txt:as much a credit to him as the way he faced his execution.’
Macbeth.txt:The King's eyes showed his sorrow. He shook his head sadly. ‘There's no way
Macbeth.txt:of reading a man's true intentions in his face. He was a gentleman on whom I had
Macbeth.txt:built an absolute trust.’
Macbeth.txt:There was excited shouting and the sound of horses in the courtyard. Duncan
Macbeth.txt:went out on to the deck and looked down. ‘Oh worthiest cousin!’ he exclaimed when
Macbeth.txt:he saw Macbeth dismounting.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth and Banquo hurried up the stairs and joined the King and his
Macbeth.txt:advisers. Duncan embraced Macbeth then stood back and looked at him.
Macbeth.txt:‘I've been racking my brains trying to think of a way of thanking you,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘It's impossible. I wish you had done less - that would have made it easier to thank
Macbeth.txt:you. I could never repay you.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Having the chance to fulfill my duty to you is reward enough,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘Your Highness' only role is to receive our duties. By protecting you we are only
Macbeth.txt:doing what's expected of us.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Welcome,’ said Duncan. He turned to Banquo. ‘Noble Banquo, you've
Macbeth.txt:deserved no less and no-one should think you have. Come, let me embrace you
Macbeth.txt:and hold you to my heart.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And if I grow there,’ said Banquo as Duncan embraced him, ‘the harvest is all
Macbeth.txt:yours.’
Macbeth.txt:The King invited everyone to be seated. He walked slowly to his chair of state.
Macbeth.txt:His face was grave, now.
Macbeth.txt:‘My undoubted good fortune and happiness must be tempered for a moment
Macbeth.txt:with some serious business,’ he told them. He beckoned to Malcolm, who rose and
Macbeth.txt:went to the chair beside his father's.
Macbeth.txt:‘Sons, kinsmen, thanes,’ said Duncan, ‘and all those close to me: you should
Macbeth.txt:know that we are making our eldest, Malcolm, our heir, and from now on he will be
Macbeth.txt:known as the Prince of Cumberland. It is an honour that carries profound
Macbeth.txt:responsibilities.’
Macbeth.txt:The assembled men clapped then they all got up and congratulated the young
Macbeth.txt:prince. Duncan called Macbeth to him.
Macbeth.txt:‘We'll go from here to Inverness and honour you with a visit,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘It'll be my pleasure,’ said Macbeth. ‘I'll be the messenger myself and take
Macbeth.txt:the joyful news to my wife. I beg leave to go now.’

Macbeth.txt:As Macbeth hurried down to the courtyard where a fresh horse was waiting the
Macbeth.txt:thoughts that had not left him for a moment became even more insistent. The
Macbeth.txt:Prince of Cumberland! That was a new development - a step over which he would
Macbeth.txt:trip unless he could jump over it: it was in his way.
Macbeth.txt:He suddenly became aware of his thoughts and they appalled him. It was a
Macbeth.txt:good thing that no light could show his black and deep desires.
Macbeth.txt:And yet ... he wished that it would happen. Exactly what, he daren't think
Macbeth.txt:about but it would be something that the eye would fear to look at.
Macbeth.txt:As he rode off Banquo was telling the King about Macbeth's astonishing
Macbeth.txt:performance in the battle.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hearing about his valour is like a banquet to me,’ said Duncan. ‘Let's follow
Macbeth.txt:him. He's so diligent that he's sped off ahead of us to prepare a royal welcome. He's
Macbeth.txt:a cousin without equal!’

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Five
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth held the letter which the messenger had just brought her. She
Macbeth.txt:paced her room, reading it aloud.
Macbeth.txt:They met me in the day of success. They have supernatural knowledge.
Macbeth.txt:When I tried to question them further they vanished into the air. While I was still
Macbeth.txt:standing there, wrapped in wonder, some messengers came from the King, calling
Macbeth.txt:me Thane of Cawdor: the title which the weird sisters had only just saluted me with!
Macbeth.txt:And they had also referred me to the future with ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’ I had to tell
Macbeth.txt:you this my dearest partner of greatness so that you wouldn't miss the joy of
Macbeth.txt:knowing what has been promised you. Think about it and farewell.
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth clutched the letter to her heart. He was Glamis already and also
Macbeth.txt:Cawdor now! And she knew he would be ... what he had been promised!
Macbeth.txt:And yet . . . . She didn't think he could pull it off. He was too full of the milk of
Macbeth.txt:human kindness to do .... what was necessary. He wanted greatness, he wasn't
Macbeth.txt:without ambition, but he had no ruthlessness in him. Whatever he wanted to
Macbeth.txt:achieve always had to be done honourably. No, he would never betray anyone. And
Macbeth.txt:yet he still wanted something he shouldn't have: what he wanted screamed out: 'If
Macbeth.txt:you want me you must do such and such!' But he feared to act on it.
Macbeth.txt:She couldn't wait for him to get home so that she could pour her influence into
Macbeth.txt:his ear, persuade him away from all the excuses that kept him from wearing the ....
Macbeth.txt:the round golden shiny headpiece that fate and the supernatural seem to have
Macbeth.txt:crowned him with already.
Macbeth.txt:There was a knock at the door. She thrust the letter behind her back guiltily.
Macbeth.txt:‘Who is it?’ she called.
Macbeth.txt:The door opened and a servant came in.
Macbeth.txt:‘The king comes here tonight,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Shhh!’ She said. ‘Don't say it! Isn't your master with him? If it were true he
Macbeth.txt:would have given me notice.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I beg your pardon, Madam, but it is true. Our Thane is on his way. A
Macbeth.txt:messenger's just arrived, so out of breath that he could hardly talk.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Go and look after him. He brings great news.’
Macbeth.txt:When the servant had gone Lady Macbeth went to the window and looked out
Macbeth.txt:over the battlements to the country through which the royal party would ride.
Macbeth.txt:‘Even the raven - the bird of death - that croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Macbeth.txt:under my battlements is hoarse,’ she said aloud. She closed her eyes and raised
Macbeth.txt:her arms to the sky. ‘Come, you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts. Take all my
Macbeth.txt:femininity away and fill me from the crown to the toe top full of direst cruelty. Make
Macbeth.txt:thick my blood, stop me from feeling pity so that no natural feelings can get in the
Macbeth.txt:way.’

Macbeth.txt:She put her hands on her breasts. ‘Come to my woman’s breasts, you spirits
Macbeth.txt:of evil, and suck gall from me where there should be milk. Come thick night and
Macbeth.txt:shroud me in the dunnest smoke of hell, so that my sharp knife won't see the wound
Macbeth.txt:it makes, nor that the light of heaven peep through the blanket of the dark to cry,
Macbeth.txt:'stop! stop!'‘
Macbeth.txt:She became aware of a noise below. She opened her eyes. It was Macbeth,
Macbeth.txt:surrounded by adoring members of the household. She turned and ran.
Macbeth.txt:‘Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!’ she cried, rushing into his arms.
Macbeth.txt:He lifted her, held her close and kissed her.
Macbeth.txt:‘Greater than both, according to the all-hail hereafter,’ she murmured as she
Macbeth.txt:kissed his ear. ‘Your letters have transported me beyond the immediate present: I
Macbeth.txt:feel the future in this moment.’
Macbeth.txt:He put her down. ‘My dearest love, Duncan comes here tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And when's he leaving?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Tomorrow as he intends.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh never shall sun that morrow see!’
Macbeth.txt:She dragged him upstairs, pulled him down on their bed and began unbuckling
Macbeth.txt:him.
Macbeth.txt:Some time later she lay, propped on her elbow, stroking his hair and staring
Macbeth.txt:into his eyes.
Macbeth.txt:‘Your face, my Thane, is like a book where one may read strange things.’ She
Macbeth.txt:kissed him. ‘To deceive everyone look like everyone else. Be welcoming: show
Macbeth.txt:welcome in your eyes, your hand, your tongue. Look like the innocent flower but be
Macbeth.txt:the serpent under it. We must provide for . .. him that's coming. And you must leave
Macbeth.txt:tonight's great business to me. Business that will shape the rest of our lives.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth said nothing. She kissed him again then looked at him with a
Macbeth.txt:question in her eyes. He sat up and lifted his clothes from the floor.
Macbeth.txt:‘We'll talk about it later,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Only be positive,’ she said. He was getting dressed. ‘To hesitate is fatal,’ she
Macbeth.txt:said. ‘Leave it all to me.’
Macbeth.txt:He went down to give the servants their instructions.

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Six
Macbeth.txt:Duncan and Banquo rode side by side as they approached Inverness.
Macbeth.txt:‘This castle is pleasantly situated,’ said Duncan. ‘The air appeals to my
Macbeth.txt:senses.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Look,’ said Banquo. ‘Swifts have built their nests here - proof of the delicacy
Macbeth.txt:and freshness of the air. See, there's no jut, frieze, buttress or corner that these
Macbeth.txt:birds haven't used. I've noticed that wherever they breed the air is delicate.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth ran out to meet them.
Macbeth.txt:‘See, see, our honoured hostess!’ exclaimed Duncan.
Macbeth.txt:A dozen grooms came to help them. The courtyard was swept so clean that
Macbeth.txt:one could see the great grey stones that paved it. Duncan smiled.
Macbeth.txt:‘People take so much trouble over my entertainment. It can be a problem but I
Macbeth.txt:do appreciate it.’ He kissed his hostess.
Macbeth.txt:‘Anything I could do, doubled and then doubled again, would be nothing
Macbeth.txt:compared with the honours your Majesty piles on our house. For everything you've
Macbeth.txt:done in the past and now these new honours, we are deeply in your debt.’
Macbeth.txt:Duncan looked around. ‘Where's the Thane of Cawdor? We tried to catch him
Macbeth.txt:but he rides fast. He's got something special to come home to, which helps his
Macbeth.txt:speed.’ Duncan looked admiringly at Lady Macbeth. ‘Beautiful and gracious
Macbeth.txt:hostess, we are your guest tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We are your servants,’ said Lady Macbeth. ‘Everything in our home is yours.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Give me your hand,’ said Duncan. ‘Conduct me to my host. We love him
Macbeth.txt:greatly and will continue our favours to him. Lead the way, if you please, hostess.’

Macbeth.txt:Act One Scene Seven
Macbeth.txt:The great hall echoed with laughter and companionable shouting, the clatter of
Macbeth.txt:huge dishes and the sounds of musicians playing in different parts of the torch-lit
Macbeth.txt:room. Duncan sat back, relaxed, comfortable in the knowledge that he was
Macbeth.txt:surrounded by friends and loyal supporters. It was good to know that Scotland was
Macbeth.txt:safe after the upheaval which the rebellion had created. His host was
Macbeth.txt:unaccountably preoccupied, staring into his tankard, but the beautiful hostess was
Macbeth.txt:as charming as ever, organizing the serving men and attending to the needs of the
Macbeth.txt:guests.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth swept his plate aside and tapped distractedly on the table. He got up
Macbeth.txt:and, pushing past the people in his way, made it to the door and out into the fresh
Macbeth.txt:air of the courtyard.
Macbeth.txt:What should he do? He faced the tower wall and pressed his forehead against
Macbeth.txt:it. If it could be all finished and done with when it's done then it may as well be done
Macbeth.txt:quickly. If only the repercussions of the murder could be controlled. If only all the
Macbeth.txt:danger could end with Duncan's death -. If only the death blow could be the end of it
Macbeth.txt:-. If only we could escape the consequences of our actions here on earth - skip the
Macbeth.txt:life to come -.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth climbed up to the battlements and looked up at the sky. There were
Macbeth.txt:no stars.
Macbeth.txt:The trouble was that we have choice: we have freedom of choice. But if we
Macbeth.txt:choose violent options they come back to plague us. And it was that law, that evenhanded justice, that was the problem. When we poison others we poison ourselves.
Macbeth.txt:Duncan. Macbeth sighed. What was he to do?
Macbeth.txt:The King trusted him completely. For two very good reasons: first as Macbeth
Macbeth.txt:was his cousin and his subject -both very powerful arguments against murder - and
Macbeth.txt:then as he was Duncan's host, who should shut the door against his murderer, not
Macbeth.txt:bear the knife himself!
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth walked slowly down the stairs and back into the courtyard. And
Macbeth.txt:anyway, Duncan was so gentle as a man, and so strong as a king, that his virtues
Macbeth.txt:would cry out for revenge at the brutality of his death. There would be outrage at the
Macbeth.txt:slaughter of such a good man: everyone would be so filled with pity that the whole
Macbeth.txt:nation would grieve.
Macbeth.txt:No, there was no excuse - only vaulting ambition, which threatened to
Macbeth.txt:overreach itself and bring him crashing down.
Macbeth.txt:A dim light fell across the courtyard. It was his wife, coming from the great hall.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hello,’ he said. ‘What's the matter?’
Macbeth.txt:She came across to him. ‘He's almost finished eating,’ she whispered. ‘Why
Macbeth.txt:have you left the banquet?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Has he asked for me?’
Macbeth.txt:

Macbeth.txt:17
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘Of course he has!’
Macbeth.txt:‘We won't go any further with this business. He's honoured me lately.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth's voice was almost pleading. ‘And I've earned golden opinions from all
Macbeth.txt:sorts of people. I want to enjoy them like new clothes - not cast them aside so
Macbeth.txt:soon.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Were you drunk when you dreamt of wearing a king's robes?’ she said. And
Macbeth.txt:has that dream slept since then, waking now, sick and trembling at what you wanted
Macbeth.txt:to do?’ She snapped her fingers. 'From now on, that's how much I value your love.’
Macbeth.txt:When he didn't say anything she took his arm and shook it.
Macbeth.txt:‘Are you afraid to be the same in your actions as you are in your desire? Do
Macbeth.txt:you want to spend the rest of your life longing for a crown, knowing that you're
Macbeth.txt:nothing more than a coward, letting 'I don't dare' answer 'I want'? Do you want to
Macbeth.txt:eat fish without getting your feet wet like the poor cat in the saying?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Stop,’ cried Macbeth. ‘Please don't. I would dare to do anything a man should
Macbeth.txt:do. There are some things no human being should even think of doing.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What animal were you then when you thought about it, only to break your
Macbeth.txt:promise to me? When you dared to do it, then you were a man. And the more you
Macbeth.txt:dared the more of a man you were in my eyes. There were no excuses then and
Macbeth.txt:now you're all excuses: they're just pouring out - making themselves! And unmaking
Macbeth.txt:you!.’
Macbeth.txt:He turned away and she went round him and faced him squarely. ‘Look here,’
Macbeth.txt:she said. ‘I have breast fed and I know what a tender thing it is to love the baby that
Macbeth.txt:milks me. I would rather pull my nipple from its boneless gums and dash its brains
Macbeth.txt:out than break a promise I've made to you!’
Macbeth.txt:They stood glaring at each other. But Macbeth's gaze began to soften and
Macbeth.txt:admiration crept in.
Macbeth.txt:‘What if we fail?’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘We fail!’ she said adamantly. ‘But if you keep your nerve we won't fail.’
Macbeth.txt:They were silent for a long time. Then she spoke again, fast and low: ‘When
Macbeth.txt:Duncan is asleep - which shouldn't be too long, after the ride he's had - I'll make
Macbeth.txt:sure his two chamber attendants are so drunk that they won't be able to remember
Macbeth.txt:a thing. And when they're lying sleeping like pigs, what can't you and I do to the
Macbeth.txt:unguarded Duncan? And what can't we pin on them? They'll take the blame for
Macbeth.txt:what we do!’
Macbeth.txt:She crept into his arms and he held her close. ‘You should have only boys,’ he
Macbeth.txt:said. ‘Your qualities are so masculine. Won't everyone think, once we have
Macbeth.txt:smeared them with blood and even used their daggers, that they've done it?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Who would dare think otherwise after we've had our say?’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth's uncertainty had evaporated. ‘I'm ready,’ he said. ‘And all my
Macbeth.txt:muscles are wound up for this act. Let's go. We'll go back and put on an act. False
Macbeth.txt:faces must hide the secrets of false hearts.’

Macbeth.txt:Act Two Scene One
Macbeth.txt:Banquo's son, Fleance, couldn't sleep. His father hadn't come in although it
Macbeth.txt:was very late. He got up and went outside. It was chilly. His father's voice came
Macbeth.txt:from behind him.
Macbeth.txt:‘What's the time, boy?’
Macbeth.txt:‘I don't know,’ said Fleance. ‘But the moon's gone down.’
Macbeth.txt:‘She goes down at twelve.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I think it's later, Sir.’ The boy turned.
Macbeth.txt:‘Wait,’ said Banquo. ‘Take my sword.’ He yawned. ‘There's economy in
Macbeth.txt:heaven: their candles are all out.’ He took his belt off. ‘Here take this too. I'm so
Macbeth.txt:tired. And yet I don't want to go to sleep. Merciful powers! What horrendous dreams
Macbeth.txt:I've been having!’
Macbeth.txt:There was the dull light of a torch and the sound of voices.
Macbeth.txt:‘Give me my sword!’ said Banquo. ‘Who's there?’ He relaxed when he heard
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth's answer: ‘A friend.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What Sir?’ said Banquo. ‘Not yet in bed? The King is. He's had a wonderful
Macbeth.txt:time and hasn't stopped talking about you.’ He took a diamond out of his pocket.
Macbeth.txt:‘This is for your wife who he calls a very kind hostess. And he's gone to bed as
Macbeth.txt:contented as a baby.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'm not tired,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘I dreamt about the three weird sisters last night,’ said Banquo. ‘They've shown
Macbeth.txt:you some truth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I don't think about them,’ said Macbeth. ‘But when we have an hour to spare
Macbeth.txt:we could talk about that business. If you don't mind.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Whenever you like.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Alright then. I'll let you know.’
Macbeth.txt:‘As long as I'm not compromised,’ said Banquo. ‘I'm all yours.’
Macbeth.txt:‘In the meantime sleep well,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘Thank you, Sir,’ said Banquo. ‘The same to you.’
Macbeth.txt:When Banquo and Fleance had gone Macbeth instructed his servant: ‘Go tell
Macbeth.txt:your mistress to ring the bell when my drink is ready. Then go to bed.’
Macbeth.txt:It was totally silent. And pitch black. It was now or never. Macbeth stared into
Macbeth.txt:the darkness. And as he looked it seemed that a dagger hung there. He closed his
Macbeth.txt:eyes and opened them again. It was still there. He peered. It didn't waver. Was it
Macbeth.txt:really a dagger? Its handle towards his hand?
Macbeth.txt:He tried to clutch it. His hand went right through it: it was still there and yet he
Macbeth.txt:couldn't feel it. Was it only a dagger of the mind, a false creation of a fevered brain?
Macbeth.txt:He could still see it as he drew his own, real, dagger: it was pointing the way to
Macbeth.txt:Duncan's room. He knew he was seeing things and yet it was so real. And now
Macbeth.txt:there was blood on it, which hadn't been there before.

Macbeth.txt:overwhelmed by them, until a bell rang and brought him back to the business in

Macbeth.txt:Act Two Scene Two
Macbeth.txt:As soon as the King's chamberlains passed out Lady Macbeth rang the bell
Macbeth.txt:then went into the dark courtyard to wait for her husband. She was excited: she had
Macbeth.txt:drunk some wine and it had filled her with fire.
Macbeth.txt:What was that!
Macbeth.txt:No it was nothing: only an owl.
Macbeth.txt:The sound of snoring came to her. It meant the doors were open! He had done
Macbeth.txt:it! The doors were open and their snores were pouring down the stairs from the bed
Macbeth.txt:chambers.
Macbeth.txt:‘Who's there?’
Macbeth.txt:Her husband's voice! They had woken up and he hadn't done it! They had
Macbeth.txt:been caught in the attempt, not the deed itself! How could he have missed the
Macbeth.txt:daggers? She had lain them out, ready. It was so easy: if Duncan hadn't looked so
Macbeth.txt:much like her father as he slept she would have done it herself.
Macbeth.txt:There was a stumbling noise in the doorway and she rushed towards it.
Macbeth.txt:‘My husband!’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's done! Didn't you hear a noise?’
Macbeth.txt:‘I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. Didn't you say something?’
Macbeth.txt:‘When?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Now.’
Macbeth.txt:‘As I came downstairs?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Listen. Who's sleeping in the room next to his?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Donalbain.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth dropped the daggers and peered at his hands in the dim light of his
Macbeth.txt:wife's torch. ‘This is a sorry sight.’
Macbeth.txt:‘A foolish thought to say a sorry sight!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Someone laughed in his sleep and another cried 'Murder! ' And they woke
Macbeth.txt:each other. I stood listening. But they said their prayers and went back to sleep.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Two of them are sharing a room,’ said Lady Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘One of them cried 'God bless us!' and the other 'Amen' . As though they had
Macbeth.txt:seen me with these hangman’s hands. Listening to their fear I couldn't say Amen
Macbeth.txt:when they cried 'God bless us!'‘
Macbeth.txt:‘Don't think about it,’ she said.
Macbeth.txt:‘But why couldn't I say Amen? I needed a blessing and Amen stuck in my
Macbeth.txt:throat.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We musn't think about it: it will drive us mad.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I thought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more! Macbeth has murdered sleep.'’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth put his head on her breast and she cradled him. ‘The innocent sleep’ he

Macbeth.txt:muttered - ‘sleep that removes our worries, the death at the end of each careworn
Macbeth.txt:day, the balm of hard work, ointment of painful minds, chief nourisher in life's feast -‘
Macbeth.txt:She pushed him away. ‘What are you talking about?’
Macbeth.txt:‘And it kept crying 'Sleep no more' so that I thought it would wake the whole
Macbeth.txt:house up. 'Glamis has murdered sleep and so Cawdor will sleep no more! Macbeth
Macbeth.txt:will sleep no more!’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth stamped her foot. ‘Who was it that cried like that? Come on,
Macbeth.txt:Thane. You make a mockery of your manhood, behaving so foolishly. Go and get
Macbeth.txt:some water and wash this filthy witness from your hands.’
Macbeth.txt:When he came back from the well with the bucket she was holding the
Macbeth.txt:daggers. ‘Why on earth did you bring them out? They have to stay there. Take them
Macbeth.txt:back and smear the grooms with blood.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth drew back and looked at her in terror. ‘I'm not going back there. I'm
Macbeth.txt:afraid to think about what I've done let alone look at it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Weakling!’ she said. ‘Give me the daggers.!’ She snatched them from him.
Macbeth.txt:‘The dead look no different from sleeping people. Fearing the dead is like a child
Macbeth.txt:fearing a painted devil. If he's bleeding I'll put some of it on the groom's faces
Macbeth.txt:because it must look as though they've done it.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth was left alone. He couldn't believe what he'd done. Suddenly there
Macbeth.txt:was a booming noise. Someone was knocking at the gate. Who was it? Why was it
Macbeth.txt:that every noise appalled him? He looked down at his hands and started. Could all
Macbeth.txt:the water in the ocean wash this blood off? It was more likely that his hands would
Macbeth.txt:turn all the earth's seas red!
Macbeth.txt:‘My hands are the same colour as yours, ' said his wife as she joined him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Although I'm sorry to say I don't feel any guilt. There's someone knocking at the
Macbeth.txt:south entry. Let's go to our room.’
Macbeth.txt:She took his hands and guided them to the bucket. ‘A little water clears us of
Macbeth.txt:this deed. See how easy it is? Listen: more knocking. Go and put your nightgown
Macbeth.txt:on: it must seem as though we've been to bed.’
Macbeth.txt:He wasn't listening. She shook him. ‘Don't be so lost in your thoughts.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's better not to think,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:As he walked away, still in a state of shock, helped by his wife, the knocking
Macbeth.txt:came again. He wished whoever it was would wake Duncan.

Macbeth.txt:The porter had been drinking all evening and it took his wife a long time to
Macbeth.txt:wake him. As he staggered out into the misty morning he muttered to himself.
Macbeth.txt:‘What a knocking this is! This is the gate of hell, this is. Knock, knock, knock!
Macbeth.txt:Who's there, in the name of Beelzebub? We've got all sorts here, I can tell you.
Macbeth.txt:Here's a farmer who hanged himself for being too greedy and losing everything.
Macbeth.txt:Alright, alright, new inmate, I'm coming! I hope you ve got enough towels: you'll
Macbeth.txt:sweat enough in here! Knock, knock. Alright!. Here's a hypocrite who sat on both
Macbeth.txt:sides so well you didn't know where he was.’
Macbeth.txt:He shivered and began running. ‘It's too cold to devil-porter it any longer.
Macbeth.txt:Alright, alright!’ He drew back the enormous bolts to admit an impatient Macduff, the
Macbeth.txt:great Thane of Fife, accompanied by Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:‘What time did you go to bed that you're having such a good lie in?’ said
Macbeth.txt:Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh very late, Sir,’ said the porter. ‘Drinking all night. And now I'm suffering:
Macbeth.txt:drink does three things to you.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff and Lennox walked towards the courtyard, followed by the porter.
Macbeth.txt:‘And what are they?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘It makes your nose red, it makes you sleep and it makes you piss. Lust, Sir, it
Macbeth.txt:encourages and discourages: it makes you want it but it makes you unable to do it.
Macbeth.txt:It makes you and breaks you. It turns you on and it turns you off. It excites you and
Macbeth.txt:it dulls you. It makes you stand up to fight and it stops you from standing up!’
Macbeth.txt:‘I think you had too much last night.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, but I've thrown it all up.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Is your master awake?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘He is now, with all that knocking,’ said the porter. ‘Here he comes.
Macbeth.txt:Good morning, noble Sir,’ said Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth wore a white robe and soft slippers. 'Good morning to you both,’ he
Macbeth.txt:said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Is the King up?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Not yet.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He told me to call for him very early. I'm almost late.’

Macbeth.txt:‘It's no trouble,’ said Macbeth. ‘There's the door.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'll just go and wake him,’ said Macduff. ‘That's what he told me to do.’ He

Macbeth.txt:‘It was a rough night,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘I can't remember anything like it,’ said Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:There was a sudden commotion, a great clatter and banging.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh horror!’ It was Macduff's voice - screaming. ‘Horror! horror!
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth and Lennox rushed to the entrance. ‘What?’ ‘What's the matter?’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff stumbled out. ‘Chaos has broken out!’ he cried. ‘Someone's stolen
Macbeth.txt:the life from the Lord's anointed temple!’
Macbeth.txt:‘What's that?’ said Macbeth. ‘The life?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Do you mean his majesty?’ said Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:‘Go and see,’ said Macduff. He covered his face with his hands. Don't tell me
Macbeth.txt:to speak. Go and look then speak yourselves.’ They hurried off up to the King's
Macbeth.txt:bedroom. ‘Wake up! Wake up!’ shouted Macduff. ‘Ring the alarm bell! Murder and
Macbeth.txt:treason! Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! Wake up! Ring the bell!’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth came out as the bell started tolling. ‘What's going on? All this
Macbeth.txt:noise! Tell me, tell me!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh gentle lady,’ sobbed Macduff. ‘It's not suitable for a woman to hear. It
Macbeth.txt:would kill you.’ He embraced Banquo, who had also just come out. ‘Oh Banquo!
Macbeth.txt:Banquo! Our royal master's been murdered.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What! In our house!’ exclaimed Lady Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘Too cruel anywhere,’ said Banquo. ‘Dear Duff, I beg of you, tell me it's not
Macbeth.txt:true.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth and Lennox returned. Everyone looked at Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘If I had died an hour before this tragedy I would have lived a good life,’ he
Macbeth.txt:said. ‘From this moment there's nothing important in life.’
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm and Donalbain came down the stairs. ‘What's wrong?’ said
Macbeth.txt:Donalbain.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth approached them and put and arm around each. ‘You are and don't
Macbeth.txt:know it,’ he said. ‘The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood, has been turned
Macbeth.txt:off. Its very source has been cut off.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Your royal father's been murdered,’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh!’ Malcolm slumped against Macbeth. ‘Who did it?’
Macbeth.txt:‘His chamberlains,’ said Lennox. ‘Their hands and faces were all smeared with
Macbeth.txt:blood. So were their daggers, which lay unwiped on their pillows. They stared like
Macbeth.txt:madmen, quite desperate.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Even so!’ exclaimed Macbeth. ‘I'm sorry about the anger that made me kill
Macbeth.txt:them.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Why did you do that?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘I couldn't help it,’ said Macbeth. ‘Anyone would have done the same. My love
Macbeth.txt:for royal Duncan was stronger than my reason.’ He swept the air in front of him.

Macbeth.txt:‘Here lay Duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood, the jagged wounds an
Macbeth.txt:affront to nature itself. There ... he pointed to the side - ‘the murderers, soaked in
Macbeth.txt:the evidence of their deed, their daggers obscenely dripping blood. Who could have
Macbeth.txt:helped himself if he'd had a heart at all?’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff was about to say something when Lady Macbeth moaned and thrust
Macbeth.txt:her hand up dramatically to her forehead. ‘Help me!’ she said and dropped down.
Macbeth.txt:‘Help the lady,’ said Macduff and servants ran to her assistance.
Macbeth.txt:They all gathered around her, showing their concern. Malcolm whispered to
Macbeth.txt:his brother: ‘Why aren't we taking charge of this? This is our business.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We'd be fools to say anything at all,’ said Donalbain. ‘It's too dangerous. Let's
Macbeth.txt:get out of here.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Careful with her there,’ said Banquo as the servants lifted Lady Macbeth. ‘And
Macbeth.txt:when we're all dressed let's meet and inquire into this violent piece of work. I'm
Macbeth.txt:determined to oppose this malicious treason.’
Macbeth.txt:‘So am I,’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:The others murmured their agreement.
Macbeth.txt:‘Let's go and get dressed then and meet in the great hall,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm and Donalbain watched them go.
Macbeth.txt:‘What will you do?’ said Malcolm. ‘We'd better not hang about here. I'm going
Macbeth.txt:to England.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Ireland for me,’ said Donalbain. ‘It'll be safer to split up. I don't trust anyone,
Macbeth.txt:least of all our closest relatives.’
Macbeth.txt:‘This poisonous arrow hasn't landed yet,’ said Malcolm. ‘The safest thing is to
Macbeth.txt:get out of its way. So let's find our horses right now. And I don't think we should be
Macbeth.txt:too fussy about making our farewells!’

Macbeth.txt:Act Two Scene Four
Macbeth.txt:The news of Duncan's death came to Ross at the castle of a friend. He
Macbeth.txt:immediately mounted his horse and rode hard until he came within sight of
Macbeth.txt:Inverness, which was almost completely hidden by the black fog. His horse was
Macbeth.txt:tired so he dismounted and led it up the hill towards the castle gates.
Macbeth.txt:An old man was labouring uphill, puffing and gasping, and Ross drew
Macbeth.txt:alongside of him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hello, Father,’ he said. ‘What news?’
Macbeth.txt:The old man shook his head. ‘Never seen the likes of it,’ he said. ‘I've seen
Macbeth.txt:some strange things in my time but this dreadful night made them seem like child's
Macbeth.txt:play.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well,’ said Ross, ‘You see, the heavens, troubled by the acts of humans,
Macbeth.txt:threaten the scene of their violence: that's what's happening. It's daytime, according
Macbeth.txt:to the clock, but darkness strangles the sun. It's hard to tell whether it's night or day,
Macbeth.txt:the way darkness entombs the face of day.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's unnatural,’ said the old man. ‘Just like the business up there.’ He lifted his
Macbeth.txt:stick and pointed. ‘Last Tuesday a falcon, surveying its prey, was hunted by a
Macbeth.txt:mousing hawk and killed.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And I hear Duncan's horses, the most perfect examples of their type, went
Macbeth.txt:wild, broke out of their stalls and refused to be controlled,’ said Ross. ‘As though
Macbeth.txt:declaring war on mankind.’
Macbeth.txt:The old man beckoned to Ross who inclined towards him. ‘They say they ate
Macbeth.txt:each other!’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:Someone was galloping towards them. He stopped when he recognized the
Macbeth.txt:Thane of Ross. It was Macduff and they greeted each other.
Macbeth.txt:‘How are things?’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘How do you think?’ said Macduff. He looked up at the sky. ‘Can't you see?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Do they know who did it?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The ones Macbeth killed. Duncan's grooms.’
Macbeth.txt:‘No! What for?’
Macbeth.txt:‘They were bribed. Malcolm and Donalbain have stolen away and fled. Which
Macbeth.txt:places suspicion on them.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Even worse,’ said Ross. ‘What ambition, to kill one's own parent. So I
Macbeth.txt:suppose Macbeth will be elected.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's already been done and he's gone to Scone to be crowned.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Where's Duncan's body?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Carried to Colme-kiln, the sacred resting place of kings.
Macbeth.txt:‘Are you going to Scone?’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘No, Cousin,’ I'm going home to Fife.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well I think I'll go.’

Macbeth.txt:Macduff rode off and Ross mounted his horse too. ‘Farewell, Father,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘God's blessing be with you,’ the old man said. ‘And with those who work to
Macbeth.txt:right wrongs and turn enemies into friends.’

Macbeth.txt:Act Three Scene One
Macbeth.txt:It had all happened so fast. Banquo was a guest of the King at Forres once
Macbeth.txt:more but it was a new king now. It was difficult to know what to think about it.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth had it all now: King, Cawdor, Glamis - everything. Just as the weird
Macbeth.txt:women had promised. And Banquo feared that his friend had played a terrible hand
Macbeth.txt:to get it. Still, they had prophesied that it wouldn't stay in his line but that he himself
Macbeth.txt:would be the root and father of many kings. If it had all come true for Macbeth
Macbeth.txt:wouldn't it happen for him too?
Macbeth.txt:Heralds at the entrance to the state rooms came to attention and blew a
Macbeth.txt:brassy fanfare. The King and Queen emerged into the courtyard.
Macbeth.txt:‘Ah,’ said Macbeth. ‘Here's our chief guest.’
Macbeth.txt:Banquo went across to them.
Macbeth.txt:‘It would be a gap in our great feast if he wasn't going to be there,’ said the
Macbeth.txt:Queen.
Macbeth.txt:The Royal couple smiled graciously.
Macbeth.txt:‘We're having a formal banquet tonight, Sir,’ said Lady Macbeth. ‘And I'll
Macbeth.txt:expect you.’
Macbeth.txt:Banquo bowed. ‘Whatever your Highness commands I will obey. I am bound
Macbeth.txt:to you with an indissoluble tie.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth swept the formality aside by putting his arm around Banquo's
Macbeth.txt:shoulders and walking him aside. ‘Are you going out this afternoon?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, my Lord,’ said Banquo.
Macbeth.txt:‘Pity,’ said Macbeth, ‘because I would have valued your good advice in today's
Macbeth.txt:council. But tomorrow will do. Are you going far?’
Macbeth.txt:‘A few hours ride, there and back,’ said Banquo. ‘I'll be back by suppertime.
Macbeth.txt:Unless my horse has difficulty. In which case it will be a bit longer.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Don't miss our banquet.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I won't, my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth beamed at him and gave him a playful punch. Then his face became
Macbeth.txt:serious. ‘We hear our murderous cousins are hiding in England and Ireland,’ he
Macbeth.txt:said. ‘Refusing to admit the cruel murder of their father, telling outrageous lies to
Macbeth.txt:anyone who'll listen. But more of that tomorrow when we'll work on state matters
Macbeth.txt:together. You'd better go then. Goodbye. See you tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:They started off in different directions. Then Macbeth turned and called after
Macbeth.txt:Banquo: ‘Is Fleance going with you?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well I wish you a good trip.’
Macbeth.txt:Courtiers, thanes and aides milled about in the courtyard.
Macbeth.txt:‘Find ways of amusing yourselves till seven tonight,’ said Macbeth. ‘We will
Macbeth.txt:spend the afternoon by ourself. God be with you.’

Macbeth.txt:He went to a private room where an attendant waited.
Macbeth.txt:‘Are those men here?’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘They are, my Lord,’ said the attendant. ‘Outside the palace gate.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Bring them to me.’
Macbeth.txt:While the attendant was gone Macbeth paced. It was all very well to put on a
Macbeth.txt:pleasant face for his guests but that wasn't how he felt. He was on edge. To
Macbeth.txt:become king was nothing. But to stay king: that's what really mattered.
Macbeth.txt:Banquo was the problem. He was a big threat: it was his great dignity that was
Macbeth.txt:so frightening. And he was fearless. And careful. Banquo was the only person in the
Macbeth.txt:world he feared and when Banquo was around he felt inferior, as Mark Antony had
Macbeth.txt:done in the presence of Octavius Caesar.
Macbeth.txt:He remembered the way Banquo had reproached the witches when they'd first
Macbeth.txt:put the name of king on him. And he had insisted that they speak to him. And when
Macbeth.txt:they did they looked respectful and hailed Banquo as the father of a line of kings.
Macbeth.txt:On his own head they had placed a fruitless crown and put a barren scepter in his
Macbeth.txt:hand! To be wrenched away by a hand not of his own family - none of his sons
Macbeth.txt:succeeding him. So it was for Banquo's descendants that he had corrupted his soul.
Macbeth.txt:He had murdered the gracious Duncan for them! Stuck thorns in his peace of mind
Macbeth.txt:just for them. And given his precious soul to the Devil to turn Banquo's sons into
Macbeth.txt:kings. All that for the seed of Banquo! Rather than that he would defy Fate and fight
Macbeth.txt:it to the death.
Macbeth.txt:The attendant returned with two rough-looking men.
Macbeth.txt:‘Go to the door and stay there until we call,’ said Macbeth. When the attendant
Macbeth.txt:had gone Macbeth nodded to the men. 'Wasn't it yesterday that we spoke?’
Macbeth.txt:‘It was,’ said one of them.
Macbeth.txt:‘Well now,’ said Macbeth. ‘Have you thought about what I said?’
Macbeth.txt:The two men exchanged glances.
Macbeth.txt:‘You know that it was he who kept you in such a low condition in the past, not
Macbeth.txt:me. I told you that yesterday. I told you everything that Banquo's done to you.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You did,’ said the first man.
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes I did,’ said Macbeth. ‘And I went further, which is the point of this meeting.
Macbeth.txt:Are you really so forgiving that you can let it go? Are you such Christians that you'd
Macbeth.txt:pray for this man and his children when his heavy hand has oppressed you and
Macbeth.txt:your children for ever?’
Macbeth.txt:‘We are men, my Liege,’ said the first.
Macbeth.txt:‘Well you pass for men,’ said Macbeth. ‘Now, if you have any manhood in you
Macbeth.txt:at all I will give you a job that will remove your oppressor while at the same time
Macbeth.txt:tighten your bond with me: I'm sick and won't be well until he's dead.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'm so bitter, my Liege,’ said the second, ‘that I don't care what I do.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Me too,’ said the first. ‘I'm so tired of hardship that I'd do anything to try and
Macbeth.txt:mend my life or else be rid of it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘So both of you know Banquo was your enemy?’
Macbeth.txt:They nodded.

Macbeth.txt:wound in my heart. I could blow him out of sight with naked power if I wanted to but
Macbeth.txt:I mustn't because certain friends who are his as well wouldn't like it. That's why I've
Macbeth.txt:come to you - to do it in private.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We'll do anything you ask of us,’ said the second man.
Macbeth.txt:‘Even though our lives -’ the first man began.
Macbeth.txt:‘Your courage is outstanding,’ Macbeth interrupted. He went to the window.
Macbeth.txt:‘Right! Within the next hour I'll advise you where to plant yourselves and you can go
Macbeth.txt:and get ready. It must be done tonight - and some distance from the palace. And
Macbeth.txt:remember, I require a good, clean job - no bungling or botches. His son, Fleance,
Macbeth.txt:will be with him. His death is just as important to me. I'll leave you alone, now, so
Macbeth.txt:that you can make up your minds in private. I'll come back in a little while.
Macbeth.txt:‘We've already decided, my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Alright. Off you go. I'll come to you straight away.’
Macbeth.txt:They went out and Macbeth smiled. Good. That was it then. If Banquo's soul
Macbeth.txt:was going to heaven it would go tonight.

Macbeth.txt:Act Three Scene Two
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth rang for a servant. When he came in to her room she said: ‘Has
Macbeth.txt:Banquo gone from court?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, Madam, but he's coming back tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Tell the king I'd like to see him when he's free. Just for a few words, tell him.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth couldn't settle down to anything. She felt very painfully that we
Macbeth.txt:gain nothing and waste everything when we get what we want without it bringing us
Macbeth.txt:happiness. It would be better to be Duncan than to be alive but tortured with fears
Macbeth.txt:and doubts.
Macbeth.txt:She heard Macbeth's footsteps approaching and she ran to the door to meet
Macbeth.txt:him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh hello, my Lord,’ she said, taking his hand. ‘Why do you hide away with
Macbeth.txt:your sad thoughts? They should have died with the person they're thinking of. You
Macbeth.txt:shouldn't worry about things you can't do anything about. What's done is done.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We've wounded the snake, not killed it,’ he said. ‘And it will recover and bite
Macbeth.txt:us. It will take forever to get rid of these nightmares that shake me nightly. It would
Macbeth.txt:be better to be with the one we killed, because we gave him peace, than to be king
Macbeth.txt:and be tortured like this. Duncan's in his grave. After the fever of life he sleeps well.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth smiled grimly. ‘Treason has done him a favour. Nothing - neither steel nor
Macbeth.txt:poison, personal problems nor politics - nothing can touch him any more.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth sat down and drew him down beside her. ‘Come on, my love.
Macbeth.txt:Don't look so downcast. Be bright and jovial with your guests tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:He looked up at her and smiled. ‘I will, my love. And I hope you will be too.
Macbeth.txt:And I want you to pay particular attention to Banquo. Treat him as a special guest in every way: how you look at him and what you say to him. We must be careful not
Macbeth.txt:to drop our guard.’
Macbeth.txt:He sunk his head into his hands and sobbed. She put her arms around his
Macbeth.txt:neck. ‘You must stop this,’ she said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh, my mind is full of scorpions,’ he said. ‘You know that Banquo and Fleance
Macbeth.txt:are still alive!’
Macbeth.txt:‘But they won't live forever.’
Macbeth.txt:‘That's true,’ he said. ‘So cheer up.’ He smiled. ‘Something dreadful's going to
Macbeth.txt:happen to them by nightfall.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Let it be a surprise, dearest darling,’ he said. He went to the window and
Macbeth.txt:looked out. ‘Come darkest night, and blindfold the caring eye of gentle day. With
Macbeth.txt:your bloody and invisible hand rip to pieces those lives that keep me in a state of
Macbeth.txt:fear. Ah, the light's getting thick and crows are flying into the dark woods: all the
Macbeth.txt:good things of day are closing their eyes while the things of night are waking up.’

Macbeth.txt:Act Three Scene Three
Macbeth.txt:The two murderers waited beside the road. The parkland was disappearing
Macbeth.txt:into the deepening gloom and they knew that it wouldn't be long before they would
Macbeth.txt:be completely invisible to anyone passing. A figure came slowly towards them from
Macbeth.txt:the direction of the palace. He seemed to be looking for them and stopped in front
Macbeth.txt:of them.
Macbeth.txt:‘All ready?’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:They had never seen him before.
Macbeth.txt:‘Who told you to join us?’ said one of them.
Macbeth.txt:‘Macbeth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He doesn't have to be suspicious. He's told us what to do and we're doing it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Alright then,’ said the other. Come and stand with us. It's almost dark. Our
Macbeth.txt:traveller won't be long now.’
Macbeth.txt:They waited without speaking until the newcomer said: ‘Listen, I hear horses.’
Macbeth.txt:The horses came nearer and then they heard a voice - Banquo's - shouting to
Macbeth.txt:the grooms. ‘Bring me a light!’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's him,’ said one of the murderers.
Macbeth.txt:‘The grooms are taking the horses,’ said the other. ‘And they're walking.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Everyone walks from here to the palace gate,’ said the stranger.
Macbeth.txt:‘Alright, get ready.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Banquo's voice came out of the dark: ‘Looks like rain tonight.’
Macbeth.txt:They jumped on him. ‘Let it come down, then!’ one said.
Macbeth.txt:Banquo struggled and fought but it was no use. They pinned him to the ground
Macbeth.txt:with their knives.
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh treachery,’ he gasped. ‘Run, Fleance, run, run. Oh you devil,’ he sighed
Macbeth.txt:with his last breath.
Macbeth.txt:They chased after Fleance but he disappeared into the dark woods.
Macbeth.txt:‘We've only half done the job,’ one of them said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Well, anyway,’ the other said. ‘Let's go and tell him what we've done.’

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Act Three Scene Four
Macbeth.txt:The huge doors of the glittering state dining room opened and the King and
Macbeth.txt:Queen stood there, smiling. Behind them the long table was set for a banquet. The
Macbeth.txt:anteroom was crowded: everyone of importance in Scotland had been commanded
Macbeth.txt:to attend - from the great thanes down to the lesser lords and their ladies - and
Macbeth.txt:almost everyone had obeyed.
Macbeth.txt:‘You all know your own rank,’ said Macbeth. ‘Come in and sit down. From the
Macbeth.txt:greatest to the least you're all most heartily welcome.’
Macbeth.txt:They filed past the King and Queen and took their seats: the more powerful a
Macbeth.txt:man was the nearer he sat to the royal couple at the head of the table.
Macbeth.txt:When they were all seated Macbeth stood up and smiled round at them.
Macbeth.txt:‘Ourself will mingle with you and play the humble host,’ he said. He swung
Macbeth.txt:round and beamed down at his radiant queen. ‘Our hostess will keep her place for
Macbeth.txt:now: she will receive you later.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Greet our friends for me, Sir,’ she said, ‘for I welcome them with all my heart.’
Macbeth.txt:While acknowledging the clapping and table thumping Macbeth glanced up at
Macbeth.txt:the doorway and saw that a new face had appeared among those of the servants. It
Macbeth.txt:was one of the murderers.
Macbeth.txt:‘See?’ Macbeth said to his wife. ‘They greet you in turn with their hearts'
Macbeth.txt:thanks.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth smiled graciously at the applauding guests. When the noise
Macbeth.txt:had subsided Macbeth spoke again.
Macbeth.txt:‘Both sides are even, then. Enjoy yourselves. In due course we'll drink a round
Macbeth.txt:of toasts.’
Macbeth.txt:He made his way to the doorway, stopping every now and then to greet one of
Macbeth.txt:the guests, until he stood beside the murderer.
Macbeth.txt:‘There's blood on your face!’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘It's Banquo's then.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's better outside you than inside him. Has he been dealt with?’
Macbeth.txt:‘My Lord, his throat is cut. I did that for him.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You're the best of the cut-throats. But whoever did the same for Fleance
Macbeth.txt:would be even better. If you did that you would be the best of them all.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Most Royal Sir.’ The murderer came closer. ‘Fleance escaped.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth stared at him. He felt one of his fits of terror coming on. Just when
Macbeth.txt:everything was going perfectly; when he was feeling safe - as firm as marble, as
Macbeth.txt:solid as rock, as free as air. Now, suddenly, he was enclosed, cramped, full of the
Macbeth.txt:most painful fears and doubts.
Macbeth.txt:‘But Banquo's safe?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, my Lord, quite safe, buried in a ditch with twenty deep gashes in his
Macbeth.txt:head - each one of them enough to kill him.’
Macbeth.txt:

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘Thanks for that,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Banquo's death was all very well but Fleance was the issue: he was the
Macbeth.txt:mature snake - his escape breeding venom in time - even though it had no teeth at
Macbeth.txt:present. There was only one thing in the world to be feared - the seed of Banquo.
Macbeth.txt:‘Go now,’ he said. ‘We'll talk again tomorrow.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth watched him and became concerned when he stopped halfway
Macbeth.txt:to his chair and seemed to be lost in thought. She got up and went to him. ‘My royal
Macbeth.txt:Lord,’ she said. ‘You're neglecting your guests. They might as well be at an inn,
Macbeth.txt:paying for their meal, without the warmth of your hospitality. If it was just food they
Macbeth.txt:wanted they could have stayed at home. Ceremony adds flavour to the meat:
Macbeth.txt:without it it's tasteless.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Thanks for reminding me,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth went back to her place and Macbeth clapped his hands loudly.
Macbeth.txt:‘Now!’ he said. ‘Bon appetite! And your good health!’ He took a tankard from a table
Macbeth.txt:and raised it. They all stood up and drank.
Macbeth.txt:Lennox, who sat at the top end of the table, signaled him to return and sit. He
Macbeth.txt:walked towards his old friend who was seated beside Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘All the greatest in the land would be under one roof if we had been honoured
Macbeth.txt:with Banquo's presence,’ he said. ‘I hope I'll have cause to confront him for his
Macbeth.txt:discourtesy rather than pity him for any accident.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He is at fault for breaking his promise,’ said Ross. Ross indicated the vacant
Macbeth.txt:chair beside Lady Macbeth's. ‘Will it please your Highness to grace us with your
Macbeth.txt:royal company?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The table's full,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Lennox pointed to the empty chair. ‘There's your place, reserved for you,’ he
Macbeth.txt:said.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth looked up. All the colour in his cheeks drained away. He swayed.
Macbeth.txt:‘What's the matter?’ said Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth backed away, not taking his eyes off his chair. Then: ‘Which of you
Macbeth.txt:have done this?’ he shouted.
Macbeth.txt:There was a change of atmosphere as people stopped eating and talking and
Macbeth.txt:looked at him. ‘Done what?’ they asked each other.
Macbeth.txt:They watched as the King pointed to the empty chair.
Macbeth.txt:‘You can't say I did it!’ he screamed. ‘Don't shake your gory locks at me!’
Macbeth.txt:Ross sprang to his feet. ‘Ladies and gentlemen, rise: his Highness is not well.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Sit!’ cried Lady Macbeth. She was moving fast to her husband. ‘Sit, worthy
Macbeth.txt:friends. His Majesty is often like this - has been since childhood. Please, just stay
Macbeth.txt:seated. It's only a brief fit. He'll be himself again in an instant. Take no notice of him:
Macbeth.txt:if you give it too much attention it will make him worse. Carry on eating and take no
Macbeth.txt:notice of him.’
Macbeth.txt:She reached his side: she took his arm and spoke urgently into his ear. ‘Are
Macbeth.txt:you a man?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, and a bold one, daring to look at something that would frighten the devil!’

Macbeth.txt:to their conversations.
Macbeth.txt:‘What nonsense!’ she said. ‘This is just a picture of your fear - the same thing
Macbeth.txt:as the dagger which you told me led you to Duncan. Come on, now - these
Macbeth.txt:outbursts are ridiculous, far more suitable for women telling winter's tales. You
Macbeth.txt:should be ashamed of yourself.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth was even paler now, and his face showed real fear.
Macbeth.txt:‘Why are you pulling faces?’ she said. ‘When all's said and done, you're only
Macbeth.txt:looking at a chair.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh yes?’ said Macbeth. ‘Look! Look there! What do you say now?’ He
Macbeth.txt:stepped forward and shook his finger at the chair. ‘Why, what do I care? If you can
Macbeth.txt:sit there nodding then you can speak, too, so say something! If the dead won't stay
Macbeth.txt:in their graves then we should feed them to birds of prey. That would stop them!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Has this foolishness completely destroyed your manhood?’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth seemed to come to himself again and he looked at her. ‘As true as I
Macbeth.txt:stand here I saw him.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Fool!’ she said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Blood has been shed before now,’ he said. ‘In the olden days, before we
Macbeth.txt:became civilized, and yes, since then, too, there have been murders too terrible for
Macbeth.txt:the human ear. There was a time that a man would die when he had his brains
Macbeth.txt:knocked out and that would be the end of him. But now they rise again with twenty
Macbeth.txt:gashes in their heads and push us off our chairs. This is even more unnatural than
Macbeth.txt:Banquo's murder.’
Macbeth.txt:‘My dear Lord,’ said Lady Macbeth, ‘your noble friends are wondering what's
Macbeth.txt:going on.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I've forgotten myself,’ he said. He addressed the guests. ‘My most worthy
Macbeth.txt:friends, don't be amazed. I have a rare illness which is nothing to those who know
Macbeth.txt:me well. Come, let's drink to love and health then I'll sit down.’ He snapped his
Macbeth.txt:fingers at a serving man. ‘Give me some wine.’ The man poured from a pitcher.
Macbeth.txt:‘Come on, fill it up,’ said Macbeth. He took the chalice. ‘I drink to the whole table.
Macbeth.txt:And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss. I wish he were here.’ He raised the
Macbeth.txt:chalice and held it up with both hands. ‘To all of you and to him, we drink. And all of
Macbeth.txt:you drink too.’
Macbeth.txt:They stood: they watched him empty the chalice then they raised their own
Macbeth.txt:tankards. Before they could drink he flung the chalice across the room. It landed
Macbeth.txt:with a mighty clatter on the stone floor.
Macbeth.txt:‘Go away!’ she shouted. ‘Get out of my sight! You should be in your grave!
Macbeth.txt:Your bones are marrowless, your blood is cold: there's no intelligence behind those
Macbeth.txt:eyes you're glaring with!’
Macbeth.txt:They all looked from him to the chair and back again. They shook their heads
Macbeth.txt:and began muttering to each other.
Macbeth.txt:‘Just think of this as a normal occurrence,’ said Lady Macbeth as loudly and
Macbeth.txt:firmly as she could. ‘That's all it is, except that it's spoiling our pleasure.’

Macbeth.txt:But it was clearly more than that. The King seemed to have shrunk. His face
Macbeth.txt:was so pale and pinched that his features were quite changed. He coughed - a
Macbeth.txt:choking, gurgling cough - and saliva foamed around his lips. ‘I dare to do anything a
Macbeth.txt:man dares,’ he muttered. He covered his eyes with his hands and whimpered. Then
Macbeth.txt:he stood up straight and looked fiercely at the empty chair. ‘Come at me like the
Macbeth.txt:rugged Russian bear, or the armour plated rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger: take any
Macbeth.txt:form but that!’ He pointed and covered his eyes. ‘And I wouldn't turn a hair. Or come
Macbeth.txt:back to life and challenge me to single combat. If I flinch then, you can call me a
Macbeth.txt:coward.’
Macbeth.txt:He flung himself to his knees. Tears streamed down his cheeks. His red eyes
Macbeth.txt:contrasted starkly with his white face. ‘Go, please go, horrible ghost. Unreal thing!
Macbeth.txt:Go!’
Macbeth.txt:Suddenly he looked round at the stunned guests. He stood up unsteadily. ‘It's
Macbeth.txt:gone. And I'm a man again.’ He was speaking haltingly, as though in pain. ‘Please,’
Macbeth.txt:he said. ‘Sit down.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's too late. You've ruined the atmosphere and destroyed the dinner with an
Macbeth.txt:astonishing loss of control,’ whispered Lady Macbeth fiercely.
Macbeth.txt:‘Can it be?’ he said. He was speaking softly, as though to himself. They were
Macbeth.txt:all gazing at him in silence. ‘That something like that can happen without your being
Macbeth.txt:amazed? You make me doubt my senses when you can see such sights and keep
Macbeth.txt:your colour while I'm drained of mine.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What sights, my Lord?’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘I beg of you,’ said Lady Macbeth. ‘Don't talk to him: he's getting worse and
Macbeth.txt:worse. I'll say good night to you all at the same time. Go now.’
Macbeth.txt:The lesser lords at the lower end of the table waited respectfully for the
Macbeth.txt:thanes.
Macbeth.txt:‘Ignore the order of going!’ Lady Macbeth almost screamed. ‘Just go as quickly
Macbeth.txt:as you can!’
Macbeth.txt:Lennox was reluctant to leave but Lady Macbeth told him with a look that his
Macbeth.txt:presence wasn't wanted.
Macbeth.txt:‘Good night,’ he said. ‘I hope his Majesty will be better soon.’
Macbeth.txt:As the last one left Lady Macbeth dismissed the attendants and closed the
Macbeth.txt:doors. Macbeth was slumped on the floor.
Macbeth.txt:‘It will have blood,’ he said. ‘They say blood will have blood. Gravestones have
Macbeth.txt:been known to tell on murderers and trees to speak their names. Soothsayers have
Macbeth.txt:used birds as omens to reveal secret murderers.’ He stood up. ‘What's the time?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Late.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth sat on his chair and adjusted his crown. ‘What do you think of
Macbeth.txt:Macduff, refusing to obey my command to come to our great banquet?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Did you ask him why he wasn't coming, Sir?’
Macbeth.txt:‘I've heard it unofficially, but I'll ask him personally. I'll get to the truth: there's
Macbeth.txt:not a household among them where I haven't got a spy.’

Macbeth.txt:suddenly she's there. They scream and give vent to their fear with animal noises of
Macbeth.txt:all kinds.
Macbeth.txt:Hecate towers over them, piercing the dark with her fierce gaze.
Macbeth.txt:‘How did you dare

Macbeth.txt:Act Three Scene Six
Macbeth.txt:Lennox rode, alone, by an indirect route, to a late night meeting with a friend
Macbeth.txt:about matters that deeply worried him and some other Scottish noblemen. He wore
Macbeth.txt:a disguise.
Macbeth.txt:He arrived at the castle of his friend and entered by a small gate at the side.
Macbeth.txt:Over dinner he spoke cautiously at first.
Macbeth.txt:‘In our former conversations I only hinted at these matters. I still say only that
Macbeth.txt:things have been done in a strange way. Macbeth pitied the gracious Duncan and,
Macbeth.txt:snap! Duncan was dead! And the brave Banquo was out too late. You can, if you
Macbeth.txt:like, say that Fleance killed him. Because Fleance fled, didn't he?’ Lennox shook his
Macbeth.txt:head. ‘The moral is, it's foolish to be out so late. And who can help thinking how
Macbeth.txt:monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father? How it
Macbeth.txt:grieved Macbeth! Didn't he immediately kill the two criminals, who were in the grip
Macbeth.txt:of drink and sleep? In pious rage? Wasn't that a good thing? Yes and very wise,
Macbeth.txt:too, because it would only have infuriated anyone who had heard them deny it! So, I
Macbeth.txt:think, all in all, that he's behaved most admirably. And I also think that if he had
Macbeth.txt:Duncan's sons under lock and key - which please God he won't! - they'd soon find
Macbeth.txt:out what it means to kill a father. And so would Fleance!’
Macbeth.txt:Lennox's friend put a hand on his arm. The two men sat in silence for a few
Macbeth.txt:moments then Lennox spoke again:
Macbeth.txt:‘Anyway, for being so outspoken and for absenting himself from the tyrant's
Macbeth.txt:feast, I hear Macduff's in disgrace. Do you know where he is?’
Macbeth.txt:His friend nodded. ‘Duncan's son, whose birthright the tyrant stole, has gone
Macbeth.txt:to the English court. He's been received most graciously by the pious Edward.
Macbeth.txt:Macduff's gone there. Malcolm's got the holy king's support in persuading the Earl
Macbeth.txt:of Northumberland, whom they call Old Siward, and his son, the renowned Young
Macbeth.txt:Siward, to help us. With the assistance of those two and God we could restore food
Macbeth.txt:to our tables and sleep to our nights, instead of this feast of bloody knives we've got
Macbeth.txt:at present: and so that we can pay homage to our rightful king and receive honest
Macbeth.txt:rewards - things we're longing for now. Well, anyway, this news from England has
Macbeth.txt:so enraged the tyrant that he's preparing for war.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Did Macbeth send to Macduff to command him to attend the feast?’ said
Macbeth.txt:Lennox.
Macbeth.txt:‘He did, and when he got a blank refusal - ‘Sir, not I’ - the surly messenger
Macbeth.txt:turned his back and muttered darkly, as though to say, ‘You'll regret this.’’
Macbeth.txt:‘Hmmm,’ said Lennox. ‘And that might well make him cautious. If he's got any
Macbeth.txt:sense he'll stay as far away as possible. I wish some holy angel would fly to the
Macbeth.txt:court of England and bring us a message from him before he returns so that our
Macbeth.txt:country, suffering under an accursed hand, can live in hope.’

Macbeth.txt:Act Four Scene One
Macbeth.txt:In a dark cave deep below the mud and slime of a lonely heath, the weird
Macbeth.txt:sisters have gathered around a boiling cauldron. A table is covered with foulsmelling, disgusting items, some half recognisable and others unfamiliar: they
Macbeth.txt:slither or flap, give little leaps, or seem to breathe. Thunder rumbles and cracks in
Macbeth.txt:the distance.
Macbeth.txt:‘Thrice the brindled cat hath mewed.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Harpier cries, 't is time, 't is time.’
Macbeth.txt:Each hag fills her apron with items from the table. They approach the
Macbeth.txt:cauldron.
Macbeth.txt:‘Round and round the cauldron go;
Macbeth.txt:In the poisoned entrails throw.
Macbeth.txt:Toad, that under cold stone
Macbeth.txt:Days and nights has thirty-one
Macbeth.txt:Sweltered venom, sleeping got,

Macbeth.txt:They join hands and lean over with their faces in the vapour from the cauldron.
Macbeth.txt:‘Double, double, toil and trouble:
Macbeth.txt:Fire, burn; and cauldron, bubble.’
Macbeth.txt:They take the items one by and drop them into the cauldron.
Macbeth.txt:‘Fillet of a fenny snake,
Macbeth.txt:In the cauldron boil and bake;
Macbeth.txt:Eye of newt, and toe of frog,
Macbeth.txt:Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
Macbeth.txt:Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting,
Macbeth.txt:Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing,
Macbeth.txt:For a charm of powerful trouble,
Macbeth.txt:Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Double, double, toil and trouble:

Macbeth.txt:‘0, well done! I commend your pains,

Macbeth.txt:And now about the cauldron sing,
Macbeth.txt:Like elves and fairies in a ring,

Macbeth.txt:The cave fills with stange creatures. They form an eerie choir which sings until
Macbeth.txt:one of the sisters shreiks, and they all scatter.
Macbeth.txt:‘By the pricking of my thumbs,
Macbeth.txt:Something wicked this way comes!’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth stood at the entrance to the cave, bewildered as to how he had come
Macbeth.txt:to be there. He could make out the dark shapes of the sisters against he dull light of
Macbeth.txt:the coals beneath the cauldron.
Macbeth.txt:‘What are you up to, you secret black and midnight hags?’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘A deed without a name,’ they said in unison.
Macbeth.txt:‘I call on you in the name of the evil magic you profess,’ he said. ‘I don't care
Macbeth.txt:how you come by this dark knowledge you have, I just want some answers. Even if
Macbeth.txt:the Devil himself gives you your powers, answer my questions.’

Macbeth.txt:‘Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths, Or from our masters.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Call them, let me see them.’
Macbeth.txt:Two of them swooped on him and held him down while the other plunged her
Macbeth.txt:hand into the foaming cauldron and pulled out a ladle. As she stirred she poured
Macbeth.txt:some liquid from a flask.
Macbeth.txt:‘Pour in sow's blood, that bath eaten
Macbeth.txt:Her nine farrow, grease, that's sweaten
Macbeth.txt:From the murderer's gibbet, throw
Macbeth.txt:Into the flame.’
Macbeth.txt:She filled the ladle and advanced on Macbeth. She placed the ladle against
Macbeth.txt:his lips. The other two squeezed his nose and held his mouth open. He kicked and
Macbeth.txt:squirmed as the foul liquid trickled down his throat, but they were strong and he was
Macbeth.txt:unable to stop them.
Macbeth.txt:He felt sick. His head ached. The weird sisters had disappeared and he
Macbeth.txt:seemed to be in a featureless place lit with a bland grey light.
Macbeth.txt:A head wearing a helmet hung in the air before him. ‘Tell me, stange
Macbeth.txt:creature Macbeth began.
Macbeth.txt:‘He knows thy thought,’ a witch's voice said. ‘Hear his speech, but say thou
Macbeth.txt:naught.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!’ the head cried. ‘Beware
Macbeth.txt:Macduff:
Macbeth.txt:beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.’ It faded and
Macbeth.txt:disappeared.
Macbeth.txt:‘Whatever you are, thanks for the warning. You've guessed my fear
Macbeth.txt:accurately. But just another word.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He will not be commanded. Here's another, More potent than the first.’
Macbeth.txt:A blood-smeared child began to take shape. ‘Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!’
Macbeth.txt:‘I'm listening.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Be bloody, bold and resolute: laugh to scorn The power of man, for none of
Macbeth.txt:woman born Shall harm Macbeth.’
Macbeth.txt:He disappeared.
Macbeth.txt:‘Then live, Macduff: why do I need to fear you? And yet I'll make doubly sure.
Macbeth.txt:You won't live.’
Macbeth.txt:A child sat before him. It had a crown on its head and a branch of a tree in its
Macbeth.txt:hand.
Macbeth.txt:‘What's this, looking like a prince? And wearing a crown?
Macbeth.txt:‘Listen, but speak not to't.’
Macbeth.txt:The apparition looked up into Macbeth's eyes.

Macbeth.txt:castle at Dunsinane! What wonderful prophesies. Excellent.’ He threw his head
Macbeth.txt:back and laughed. ‘Dead enemies, don't rise out of your graves until Birnam wood
Macbeth.txt:walks. That means King Macbeth will live the natural length of his life, only giving it

Macbeth.txt:‘My heart aches to know one thing: tell me - if your magic extends that far - will

Macbeth.txt:‘Show!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Show!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Show!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Show his eyes and grieve his heart; Come like shadows, so depart.’
Macbeth.txt:The grey light brightened until it was a white blaze. Music was playing and
Macbeth.txt:what looked like a parade was taking place. There were several main figures,
Macbeth.txt:wearing crowns and waving as though to adoring crowds. They came closer and the
Macbeth.txt:leader waved specifically at Macbeth. Terror gripped him as he recognized him.
Macbeth.txt:‘You're the image of Banquo!’ he cried. ‘Away!’ The golden crown caught the
Macbeth.txt:light and Macbeth covered his eyes. ‘Ah! your crown's searing my eye-balls!’
Macbeth.txt:The second figure was passing him now. He also looked like Banquo. The
Macbeth.txt:same hair exactly. ‘And the third is like the others. Filthy bags! Why are you
Macbeth.txt:showing me this?’
Macbeth.txt:The fourth figure was just like the others. ‘Start! Eyes!’ cried Macbeth. ‘Does
Macbeth.txt:this go on forever?’
Macbeth.txt:There were a fifth and sixth and then a seventh. ‘I don't want to see any
Macbeth.txt:more! And still, an eighth.’ The eighth carried a mirror which reflected even more,
Macbeth.txt:stretching back as far as his eyes could see.
Macbeth.txt:‘And some of them are carrying triple scepters. Horrible sight! Now I can see
Macbeth.txt:it's true,’ he said as the bloody Banquo came into view and leered at him. ‘He points
Macbeth.txt:at the kings, claiming them as his issue. Can it be?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Aye, Sir, all this is so: - but why
Macbeth.txt:Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
Macbeth.txt:Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
Macbeth.txt:And show the best of our delights.
Macbeth.txt:I'll charm the air to give a sound,

Macbeth.txt:unpleasant about it. Round and round the dancers went, making him feel sleepy. He
Macbeth.txt:dozed and immediately found himself waking beside his horse in the open air of the
Macbeth.txt:heath.
Macbeth.txt:‘Where are they?’ he said, looking round to see only the white sky and the flat
Macbeth.txt:heath. ‘Gone?’ He sat up. ‘Let this day be forever cursed in the calendar.’
Macbeth.txt:Lennox had come with him and he was still waiting where Macbeth had told
Macbeth.txt:him to.
Macbeth.txt:‘Did you see the weird sisters?’ said Macbeth. Lennox frowned. ‘No, my

Macbeth.txt:‘They must have come past you.
Macbeth.txt:‘No, I saw no-one.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth remembered how they had vanished into the air the first time he had

Macbeth.txt:galloping of horses. Who was it?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Messengers, my Lord, bringing you word that Macduff has fled to England.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Fled to England?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth was furious. He should have done it before it was too late! If you
Macbeth.txt:want to do something you should do it at once. From that moment there would be
Macbeth.txt:no hesitating: he would act as soon as he had the idea. And he had an idea right
Macbeth.txt:now: he would surprise Macduff's castle and put his wife and children and anyone
Macbeth.txt:else he could find there to the sword. He wouldn't brag about it like a fool, he would

Macbeth.txt:‘What's he done, that he's had to flee to England?’ said Lady Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘You must try and understand,’ said Ross. ‘And have patience.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He had none! It's madness. I know he's not a traitor but now it will look like it!’
Macbeth.txt:‘You don't know what's in his mind,’ said Ross. ‘There may be some wisdom in
Macbeth.txt:it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Wisdom! To leave his wife, his babies, his castle, all his possessions, in a
Macbeth.txt:place he's fleeing from? He doesn't love us. Where's his fatherly instinct? Even the
Macbeth.txt:tiny wren, the smallest of birds will stay and fight an owl to save her chickens. His
Macbeth.txt:fear's greater than his love for his family. Don't talk to me about wisdom! There's no
Macbeth.txt:reason in his flight!’ She flung herself down on a chair and sobbed.
Macbeth.txt:Her young son ran to her and stroked her hair. Ross put an arm around her.
Macbeth.txt:‘Control
Macbeth.txt:yourself, my dearest cousin, I beg of you.’ He went to the door, looked into the
Macbeth.txt:corridor, closed the door and came back to her. ‘Listen. Your husband is noble and
Macbeth.txt:wise. He's clever and has a deep understanding of the politics of the present time.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macduff looked doubtfully at him.
Macbeth.txt:‘I daren't say any more - but I'll just say this: the times are bad when the most
Macbeth.txt:loyal people are accused of being traitors - when we listen to rumours just because
Macbeth.txt:we’re so afraid, and don't even know what it is we fear but are just battered by
Macbeth.txt:troubles - coming from all directions.’
Macbeth.txt:He kept looking towards the door as he spoke. ‘I can't say any more,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘I have to go now but I'll be back soon. Things can't get any worse so they'll either
Macbeth.txt:end or start getting back to how they were.’
Macbeth.txt:He ruffled the boy's hair. ‘Bless you, my pretty cousin.
Macbeth.txt:‘He's an orphan even though he has a father,’ said Lady Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘I would look a fool if I were to stay any longer,’ said Ross. ‘I'd start crying and
Macbeth.txt:embarrass you. So I'll go at once.’
Macbeth.txt:When he had gone Lady Macduff drew the child on to her knee. ‘Your father's

Macbeth.txt:‘Like a bird, Mother.’
Macbeth.txt:She brightened up, then. ‘What? By eating worms and flies?’
Macbeth.txt:‘By eating whatever I can find, I mean. Like they do.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Poor little chicken.’ She cuddled him. ‘You've never had to be afraid of nets,

Macbeth.txt:‘Why should I, Mother? No-one would want to trap such an unimportant bird.
Macbeth.txt:Anyway, my father's not dead, whatever you may say!’

Macbeth.txt:‘Yes he was.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What's a traitor?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Someone who swears and lies: swears to love you and protect you without
Macbeth.txt:meaning it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And are all those who do that traitors?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Every one,’ she said. ‘And they should all be hanged!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Who'd hang them?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The honest men, of course.’
Macbeth.txt:The boy laughed. ‘Then the liars and swearers are fools: because there are
Macbeth.txt:enough liars and swearers to beat the honest men up and hang them!’
Macbeth.txt:She laughed. ‘God help you, poor monkey.’ Then her face became serious
Macbeth.txt:again. ‘But what are you going to do for a father?’
Macbeth.txt:‘If he were really dead you'd be crying and if you weren’t it would be a good
Macbeth.txt:sign that I'd soon have a new father.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Little chatterbox. You could go on forever.’
Macbeth.txt:The door burst open and a travel-worn man came in.
Macbeth.txt:‘Don't be alarmed, fair Madam,’ he said as she pushed the child from her and
Macbeth.txt:sprang up. ‘You don't know me, although I'm well aware of your rank. Listen, I
Macbeth.txt:haven't got much time. You're in immediate danger. You must leave right now. Take
Macbeth.txt:your little ones and go! I'm sorry to frighten you like this but not to warn you would
Macbeth.txt:be far worse. Go now: the danger is close.’ He made for the door. ‘Heaven protect
Macbeth.txt:you. I dare not stay any longer.’ And he was gone.
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macduff looked about desperately. ‘Where can I go to? I've done
Macbeth.txt:nothing.’
Macbeth.txt:There was some screaming somewhere and the child ran to her and clung to
Macbeth.txt:her. They stayed, frozen, listening to the commotion outside, then two men
Macbeth.txt:appeared in the doorway and came in.
Macbeth.txt:‘Who are you?’ said Lady Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Where's your husband?’ one of them said.
Macbeth.txt:‘I hope he's not anywhere so unsanctified that someone like you might find
Macbeth.txt:him,’ she said.
Macbeth.txt:‘He's a traitor,’ the one with the shaggy hair said. The boy rushed at him and
Macbeth.txt:kicked him in the shin. ‘You lie, you shaggy-haired lout!’ he cried.
Macbeth.txt:‘What?’ The man grabbed him as he was about to kick him again. ‘You egg!’
Macbeth.txt:He drew his dagger and thrust it viciously into the boy's spine. Blood spurted on to
Macbeth.txt:his face. ‘You traitor's spawn!’
Macbeth.txt:The boy turned pale and blood trickled out of his mouth and down his chin.
Macbeth.txt:The shaggy haired man rubbed his shin. Lady Macduff stood with her mouth open,
Macbeth.txt:unable to scream.

Macbeth.txt:Act Four Scene Three
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm ushered Macduff out into a garden at King Edward's palace. The sun
Macbeth.txt:shone out of a cloudless sky. ‘Let's find some shade and pour our sorrows out to
Macbeth.txt:each other,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:Macduff frowned. ‘Let's rather take our swords and defend our poor country
Macbeth.txt:like brave men,’ he said. He followed Malcolm towards a shady bower beside a
Macbeth.txt:fountain. ‘Every day there are new widows and orphans. New howls of grief reach
Macbeth.txt:up to heaven every day.’
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm sat down and invited Macduff to join him on the bench. ‘I'll only weep
Macbeth.txt:for what I think is true,’ he said. ‘And only believe what I know to be a fact. Perhaps
Macbeth.txt:what you've told me is true, and if and when I discover that then it will be the time to
Macbeth.txt:take up swords. After all, this tyrant, whose name blisters everyone's tongue, was
Macbeth.txt:once considered noble and honourable. And you loved him greatly: he's done
Macbeth.txt:nothing to you yet. I'm young and powerless but how do I know you're not trying to
Macbeth.txt:win favour with him by deceiving me? It's possible that you think there may be some
Macbeth.txt:advantage in offering up a weak, poor, innocent lamb like me as a sacrifice to an
Macbeth.txt:angry god.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff looked at him with indignation. ‘I'm not treacherous,’ he said.
Macbeth.txt:‘Ah, but Macbeth is. You see, a good and virtuous nature may give way under
Macbeth.txt:pressure from a determined king.’ Malcolm watched his visitor closely as he talked.
Macbeth.txt:‘But it doesn't matter what I think - it won't change what you may or may not be.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff looked at the ground. ‘That's the end of my hopes, then.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Perhaps it was just that - your action in coming to England - that made me
Macbeth.txt:suspicious,’ said Malcolm. ‘Why did you leave your wife and children in such a hurry
Macbeth.txt:and unprotected?’ Macduff's chin had sunk to his chest and Malcolm touched his
Macbeth.txt:hand. ‘Please don't let my suspicions put you off. You must understand that I have
Macbeth.txt:to protect myself: you may be truly honourable, whatever I may think.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Bleed, bleed, poor country!’ groaned Macduff. ‘Tyranny's foundation is very
Macbeth.txt:firm when goodness won't stop it: it can commit its crimes openly. Its claim to the
Macbeth.txt:throne has become unassailable because everyone lives in fear of it!’ He stood up.
Macbeth.txt:‘Goodbye, my Lord. I wouldn't be the scoundrel you take me for the whole of
Macbeth.txt:Scotland. And the rich East as well!’
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm patted the bench and indicated calmly for Macduff to sit down again which he did. ‘Don't be offended,’ he said. ‘I'm not absolutely certain that you're
Macbeth.txt:someone to be feared. I can see our country sinks beneath the yoke. It's crying, it's
Macbeth.txt:bleeding: and every day a gash is added to her wounds. I also think there would be
Macbeth.txt:many people prepared to join me in an effort to regain my rights. And here in
Macbeth.txt:England, gracious Edward has offered me thousands of men. But for all that, once I
Macbeth.txt:had defeated the tyrant, my poor country would have more misery than it had had
Macbeth.txt:before - more suffering and more evils from the one who succeeds.’

Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:‘Who would that be?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm stood now, and looked down at the unhappy thane. ‘I mean myself. I
Macbeth.txt:know enough about myself to realize that I have so many potential vices that should
Macbeth.txt:they be given reign the venomous Macbeth would seem as pure as snow. And the
Macbeth.txt:miserable country would consider him a lamb compared with my boundless evil.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff shook his head. ‘Impossible. You wouldn't find anyone more evil than
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth in hell!’
Macbeth.txt:‘I agree he's bloody, lecherous, greedy, false, deceitful, bad tempered,
Macbeth.txt:malicious, full of every sin you can name. But there's no end to my lust - none. All
Macbeth.txt:the wives, daughters and mothers in Scotland couldn't satisfy my lust. I would stop
Macbeth.txt:at nothing. It's better that Macbeth reign than such a man.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff stood up and shook his head sadly. ‘Excessive behaviour has brought
Macbeth.txt:many kings down. But you'll still be preferable to him. You will still be able to take
Macbeth.txt:your pleasure: there are enough willing women in Scotland. You can't be so
Macbeth.txt:insatiable that you'd get through all the women who'd be prepared to give
Macbeth.txt:themselves to the king if he wanted them.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Perhaps so,’ said Malcolm. ‘But in addition to that I have such a bottomless
Macbeth.txt:greed that if I were king I would top the noblemen for their lands; I would want this
Macbeth.txt:one's jewels, that one's house. And the more I had the more it would make me want
Macbeth.txt:so that I would manufacture quarrels with the good and loyal and destroy them just
Macbeth.txt:for their wealth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘This greed is bad,’ said Macbeth. ‘Worse than a bit of lust: it's brought many
Macbeth.txt:of our kings to grief, but don't worry: there's enough wealth belonging to the crown
Macbeth.txt:in Scotland to satisfy you. These two vices, weighed against your virtues, can be
Macbeth.txt:accommodated.’
Macbeth.txt:‘But I don't have any virtues!’ exclaimed Malcolm. Not the virtues that would
Macbeth.txt:make a good king, such as justice, honesty, temperence, stability, generosity,
Macbeth.txt:perseverance, mercy, humility, devoutness, patience, courage, fortitude. I've no
Macbeth.txt:taste for them: but I've got limitless variations on the vices. Indeed, if I had power I
Macbeth.txt:would turn all peace into war and destroy all the harmony on earth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh Scotland! Scotland!’ Macduff shook his head.
Macbeth.txt:‘If such a man is fit to govern, tell me,’ said Malcolm. ‘Because that's what I
Macbeth.txt:am.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Fit to govern?’ Macduff was incredulous. ‘No, not to live. 0 unhappy nation!
Macbeth.txt:When will you see your wholesome days again? Your royal father was a saint. The
Macbeth.txt:queen who bore you, more often on her knees than on her feet, lived every day as
Macbeth.txt:though it was going to be her last.’ He turned and began walking to the palace. He
Macbeth.txt:stopped. ‘Farewell. The things you've told me have banished me from Scotland. Oh,
Macbeth.txt:my heart, your hope ends here.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Macduff,’ said Malcolm, coming towards him. ‘Your noble reaction has
Macbeth.txt:removed my suspicion and convinced me of your honour. I'm placing myself under
Macbeth.txt:your leadership and withdrawing my allegations against myself. I'm not like that at
Macbeth.txt:all. I've never been with a woman; I've never perjured myself, hardly ever coveted

Macbeth.txt:something that wasn't my own and never broken a promise. I'm truly your and my
Macbeth.txt:poor country’s to command. And I can tell you now. Even at this moment, Old
Macbeth.txt:Siward is setting out with ten thousand men. So let's go. Why are you so quiet?’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's hard to reconcile such welcome and unwelcome things at the same time.
Macbeth.txt:Who's this?’
Macbeth.txt:A man was walking towards them across the lawn.
Macbeth.txt:‘He's our countryman but I don't recognize him,’ said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:Macduff suddenly began running towards the newcomer. ‘Ross! My dear
Macbeth.txt:cousin, welcome!’
Macbeth.txt:‘I recognize him now,’ said Malcolm. ‘Pray God remove the circumstances
Macbeth.txt:which makes us strangers.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Amen to that, Sir,’ said Ross.
Macbeth.txt:‘Are things still the same in Scotland?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Alas, poor country!’ said Ross. ‘Almost afraid to know itself. It can't be called
Macbeth.txt:our mother, but our grave - where no-one ever smiles anymore; where no-one takes
Macbeth.txt:any notice of the groaning and shrieking of torture; where violent sorrow is
Macbeth.txt:commonplace. No-one asks who's funeral the bell is tolling for and good men's lives
Macbeth.txt:are shorter than the flowers they wear in their hats - dying even before they begin to
Macbeth.txt:fade!’
Macbeth.txt:‘What's the latest?’ said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘News that's only an hour old is already stale. There's something new every
Macbeth.txt:minute.’
Macbeth.txt:‘How's my wife?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:Ross hesitated before he spoke. Then: ‘Why . . . she's well.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And all my children?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well too,’ said Ross. He bent down to smell a rose.
Macbeth.txt:‘The tyrant hasn't interfered with their peace?’
Macbeth.txt:‘No, they were at peace when I left them.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff raised his voice. ‘You're holding something back. Out with it.’
Macbeth.txt:Ross ignored him and spoke to Malcolm: ‘When I was on my way here
Macbeth.txt:everyone I met said this is the moment. Your presence in Scotland would inspire
Macbeth.txt:everyone to fight. Even our women would respond.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Let them take comfort. We re on our way. Gracious England has lent us
Macbeth.txt:Siward and ten thousand men. You couldn't find a more experienced and better
Macbeth.txt:soldier.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I wish I could answer that with similar comfort. But I have words that should
Macbeth.txt:be howled out in the desert air where there are no ears to hear them.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Concerning what?’ said Macduff. He looked tense. ‘Is it about the political
Macbeth.txt:situation or something personal?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Something shared,’ said Ross. He looked at his cousin now. ‘But mainly to do
Macbeth.txt:with you.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Quickly, let me have it,’ said Macduff.

Macbeth.txt:ever heard.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Ha! I've already guessed it,’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Your castle was surprised; your wife and babes savagely slaughtered. If I
Macbeth.txt:were to relate the details to you it would kill you.’
Macbeth.txt:Macduff bent forward as though he had been hit in the stomach and stayed
Macbeth.txt:unmoving for a long time.
Macbeth.txt:‘Come on,’ said Malcolm at last. ‘Don't muffle yourself. Say something. If you
Macbeth.txt:don't give expression to your grief it'll break your heart.’
Macbeth.txt:‘My children too?’ said Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:‘Wife, servants, everyone they could find.’
Macbeth.txt:‘And I had to be away at the time! My wife killed too?’
Macbeth.txt:‘I've told you.’
Macbeth.txt:Malcolm put his hand on Macduff's shoulder. ‘There's some comfort: we're
Macbeth.txt:going to get revenge.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He has no children,’ said Macduff. He stared at Ross. ‘All my pretty ones? Did
Macbeth.txt:you say all?’ He kicked the exposed root of an apple tree. ‘Oh hell-kite!’ He turned
Macbeth.txt:back to Ross. ‘All? What? All my pretty chickens and their mother at one fell
Macbeth.txt:swoop?’ He walked away from them and cried.
Macbeth.txt:‘Take it like a man,’ said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘I will,’ said Macduff. ‘But I must also feel it like a man. Nothing was as
Macbeth.txt:precious to me. Did heaven watch and not come to their help? Oh, it's my fault.
Macbeth.txt:They were killed because of me! Not because of their faults but for mine. Heaven
Macbeth.txt:rest them now.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Let this sharpen your sword. Let grief turn into anger, ' said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘I could waste time crying,’ said Macduff. ‘But gentle heavens, let's not delay.
Macbeth.txt:Bring this fiend of Scotland and me face to face. Bring him within my sword's length.
Macbeth.txt:If he escapes let my punishment be that heaven forgives him.’
Macbeth.txt:‘That's more like it,’ said Malcolm. ‘Come let's go to the King. Our army’s

Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene One
Macbeth.txt:The success of the rebels had forced the King to retreat to his northern castle
Macbeth.txt:at Dunsinane and it was from there that he was conducting the war.
Macbeth.txt:It was late. A doctor stood in a recess of the wall of a dark corridor with one of
Macbeth.txt:the Queen's gentlewomen-in-waiting. ‘I've watched with you for two nights but I'm
Macbeth.txt:beginning to doubt your story,’ he said. When did you say she last walked?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Since his Majesty went into the field I've seen her rise from her bed, put on
Macbeth.txt:her nightgown, unlock her cabinet, take out a piece of paper, fold it, write on it, read
Macbeth.txt:it, then seal it and return to bed. And fast asleep all the time.’
Macbeth.txt:‘It's very unnatural to behave as though she were awake while being asleep,’
Macbeth.txt:said the doctor. ‘Apart from this sleep walking and the writing and so on, what have
Macbeth.txt:you heard her say?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Oh, I wouldn't dare tell you, Sir.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You may tell me, and it's appropriate to do so.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Not to you, nor anyone. There's no witness to confirm it.’ There was a point of
Macbeth.txt:candlelight some way along the corridor. ‘Shhhh!’ she said. ‘Look. Here she comes.
Macbeth.txt:This is exactly like it was before and there, you see? Fast asleep. Watch her and
Macbeth.txt:don't move.’
Macbeth.txt:‘How did she get that light?’
Macbeth.txt:‘It was at her bedside. She has a lighted candle with her all the time. She's
Macbeth.txt:ordered it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You see?’ said the doctor. ‘Her eyes are open.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, but she can't see anything.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth stopped near them. She was examining her hands closely.
Macbeth.txt:‘What's she doing?’ whispered the doctor. ‘Look how she's rubbing her hands.’
Macbeth.txt:‘She always does that. As though washing them. I've known her do that for a
Macbeth.txt:quarter of an hour.’
Macbeth.txt:‘There's still a spot here,’ said Lady Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘Listen!’ The doctor took a notebook and a piece of chalk out of his pocket.
Macbeth.txt:She's speaking. I'll write it down.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Come out, damned spot,’ said Lady Macbeth fiercely, rubbing violently. She
Macbeth.txt:stopped, as though listening to something. ‘One - two. Two o'clock: it's time to do it.
Macbeth.txt:hell is dark. What my Lord? Shame! A soldier and frightened? What do we care who
Macbeth.txt:knows when no-one can question us? But who would have thought the old man to
Macbeth.txt:have had so much blood in him?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Do you hear that?’ said the doctor.
Macbeth.txt:‘The Thane of Fife had a wife,’ continued Lady Macbeth. ‘Where is she now?’
Macbeth.txt:She returned to washing her hands. ‘Will these hands never be clean? No more of
Macbeth.txt:that, my Lord - no more of that: you're ruining it all with your nervousness.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Dear, dear,’ sighed the doctor. ‘You've done some things you shouldn't have.’

Macbeth.txt:what she's done.’
Macbeth.txt:Lady Macbeth lifted her hands to her face. ‘They still smell of blood,’ she said.
Macbeth.txt:‘All the perfumes of Arabia couldn't make this little hand smell sweet.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What a sigh that was,’ said the doctor. ‘Her heart is heavily burdened.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I wouldn't have her heart in my bosom for anything,’ said the gentlewoman.
Macbeth.txt:The doctor shook his head. ‘Well, well, well.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I wish it were well, Sir.’
Macbeth.txt:‘This goes beyond the practice of medicine. Still, I've known some who've
Macbeth.txt:walked in their sleep and have lived good lives.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Wash your hands!’ shouted Lady Macbeth. ‘Put on your night-gown. Don't
Macbeth.txt:look so pale. I'll tell you once more:
Macbeth.txt:Banquo's buried: he can't come out of his grave.’
Macbeth.txt:‘That too?’ said the doctor.
Macbeth.txt:‘To bed, to bed, there's someone knocking at the gate,’ said Lady Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘Come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's done can't be undone. To
Macbeth.txt:bed, to bed, to bed.’ She lifted the candle and returned down the corridor.
Macbeth.txt:‘Will she go to bed now?’ said the doctor.
Macbeth.txt:‘Straight away.’
Macbeth.txt:‘There are terrible rumours about,’ said the doctor. ‘Unnatural acts will create
Macbeth.txt:unnatural scenes like this. Sick minds let out their secrets in the dead of night. She
Macbeth.txt:has more need of a priest than a doctor. Oh, may God forgive us all! Look after her.
Macbeth.txt:Take away anything that she could use to harm herself with. And don't take your
Macbeth.txt:eyes off her. So. Good night. She's stunned my mind and amazed my sight. I think I
Macbeth.txt:know what's going on but I dare not say anything.’

Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Two
Macbeth.txt:As the rebels had advanced they had been joined by some of the most
Macbeth.txt:powerful thanes in Scotland, and now they were only a few miles from Dunsinane,
Macbeth.txt:the castle to which they had driven the King. They set up their camp and prepared
Macbeth.txt:themselves for the final thrust.
Macbeth.txt:‘The English forces are close,’ said Menteith. Malcolm and Macduff are
Macbeth.txt:burning for revenge and as they marched people were so affected by their cause
Macbeth.txt:that they could have recruited the sick and dying - even the dead!’
Macbeth.txt:Angus traced a finger across his map. ‘We'll meet them near Birnam Wood.’
Macbeth.txt:He pointed to a thick line. ‘They're coming this way.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Does anyone know whether Donalbain is with them?’ said Caithness.
Macbeth.txt:‘Definitely not, Sir,’ said Lennox. ‘I've got a list of all the officers. Siward's son's
Macbeth.txt:there, and a lot of smooth faced youths.’
Macbeth.txt:‘What's the tyrant up to?’ said Menteith.
Macbeth.txt:‘He's dug himself in to Dunsinane. Some say he's mad:
Macbeth.txt:others, more charitable, call it courageous anger, but one thing's for sure: He can't
Macbeth.txt:keep his suffering country under control.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Now he can feel his hands sticky with his secret murders,’ said Angus. ‘Now,
Macbeth.txt:as men desert him in droves, he knows what it was like for Duncan. Those who are
Macbeth.txt:still with him don't have their hearts in it. Now he feels his title hanging loosely on
Macbeth.txt:him like a giant's robe on a dwarfish thief.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He must be as revolted by himself as we are,’ said Menteith, ‘and it's no
Macbeth.txt:wonder he's behaving like a madman.’
Macbeth.txt:They sat until late talking about how they were going to restore the rightful king
Macbeth.txt:to the throne, even if it took every drop of their blood to heal their country.

Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Three
Macbeth.txt:A young officer came into the campaign room where Macbeth was pacing
Macbeth.txt:among his closest advisers.
Macbeth.txt:‘Don't bring me any more reports!’ said Macbeth. ‘I don't care if every single
Macbeth.txt:one of them deserts me: nothing will bother me until Birnam Wood comes to
Macbeth.txt:Dunsinane.’ He laughed and some of those present joined him.
Macbeth.txt:‘What danger is the boy Malcolm? Wasn’t he born of woman? The spirits that
Macbeth.txt:know everything that's going to happen to human beings told me: ‘Don't be afraid,
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth:
Macbeth.txt:no man that's born of woman will ever have power over you. That's what they said.’
Macbeth.txt:He went to the window and leant out. ‘Then fly, treacherous thanes!’ he
Macbeth.txt:shouted to the open countryside. ‘And join the English weaklings!’ He turned back to
Macbeth.txt:his silent officers. ‘My strength of mind and courage will never collapse with doubt or
Macbeth.txt:shake with fear,’ he told them.
Macbeth.txt:A servant came in and stood looking as though he hoped he wouldn't be
Macbeth.txt:noticed.
Macbeth.txt:‘The Devil damn you black you cream-faced loon!’ screamed Macbeth. ‘Where
Macbeth.txt:did you get that goose-look?’
Macbeth.txt:‘There are ten thousand …’
Macbeth.txt:‘Geese, scoundrel?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Soldiers, Sir.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth raised his arm and the boy cowered. ‘Go and prick your face and
Macbeth.txt:cover your paleness with blood, you coward!’ he yelled. ‘What soldiers, clown?
Macbeth.txt:Damn you! Those white cheeks of yours are hideous.’
Macbeth.txt:The youth trembled. He opened his mouth but couldn't speak.
Macbeth.txt:‘What soldiers, whey-face?’
Macbeth.txt:‘The English force, Sir.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth took him by the scruff of the neck and marched him to the door. ‘Get
Macbeth.txt:your face out of here!’ He opened the door and threw the boy out. ‘Seyton!’ he
Macbeth.txt:called. ‘I get fed up when I see …. Seyton, where are you?’
Macbeth.txt:The doctor, who had been sitting among the attendants, rushed across to
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth, who pushed him away.
Macbeth.txt:This was a crisis and it would be solved one way or another. It made no
Macbeth.txt:difference how it ended: he had lived too long. His career had turned into a dry,
Macbeth.txt:withered scrap like a leaf about to fall. All the things that one should enjoy in old age
Macbeth.txt:- honour, love, respect, friends -he wouldn't have now. Instead he'd have curses perhaps not spoken aloud, but heartfelt - lip-service - mere air -which he would
Macbeth.txt:rather do without.

Macbeth.txt:‘I'll fight until my flesh has been hacked off my bones. Give me my armour.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You don't need it yet,’ said Seyton.
Macbeth.txt:‘I want to put it on. Go and get it. Send more horses out. Search the
Macbeth.txt:countryside: hang anyone who talks of defeat. And get my armour.’
Macbeth.txt:Seyton left and Macbeth turned to the doctor. ‘How's your patient, doctor?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Not sick as much as troubled with incessant fantasies that stop her from
Macbeth.txt:sleeping.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well cure her of that, then.’
Macbeth.txt:The doctor shook his head.
Macbeth.txt:‘Can't you treat a sick mind? Remove a terrible experience from the memory?
Macbeth.txt:Rub out the troubles printed on the mind and cover over the terror of a guilty heart
Macbeth.txt:with some pain-killing drug?’
Macbeth.txt:‘That's something the patient must do himself.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth stared at the doctor for a moment then he made a dismissive
Macbeth.txt:gesture. ‘Throw medicine to the dogs! I don't need it.’
Macbeth.txt:Seyton came in, followed by two servants carrying Macbeth's armour.
Macbeth.txt:‘Come, put it on. Where's my commander's baton?’ He pointed at the doctor.
Macbeth.txt:‘Doctor, the thanes are fleeing from me.’ He turned back to Seyton. ‘Come on,
Macbeth.txt:hurry. If, Doctor, you could analyse a sample of my country's water and diagnose
Macbeth.txt:her disease, then bring it back to perfect health, I would applaud you to the rafters
Macbeth.txt:and the echo of that would applaud again
Macbeth.txt:He snarled at the servants: they had positioned one of the pieces incorrectly.
Macbeth.txt:‘Pull it off: go on, pull it off. Doctor, what rhubarb or senna or other purgative drug
Macbeth.txt:would purge these English.’
Macbeth.txt:He walked away from the servants, who had only half finished dressing him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Bring it with you.’ He strode to the door and out, towards the battlements. ‘I won't

Macbeth.txt:‘Not long now, cousins,’ said Malcolm. ‘Scots will soon be able to sleep safely
Macbeth.txt:in their beds.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We have no doubts at all,’ said Menteith.
Macbeth.txt:‘What wood is that?’ said Siward.
Macbeth.txt:‘Birnam Wood,’ said Menteith.
Macbeth.txt:‘Right,’ said Malcolm. ‘Tell every soldier to cut down a branch and carry it in
Macbeth.txt:front of him. That will conceal our numbers.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I hear the insolent tyrant has stayed in Dunsinane and doesn't seem to mind
Macbeth.txt:our laying siege to it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘There's nothing else he can do,’ said Malcolm. Everyone’s deserted him: the
Macbeth.txt:ones who've stayed have been forced to and their hearts aren't in it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘There's no point talking about it,’ said the impatient Macduff. ‘Let's get on with
Macbeth.txt:it.
Macbeth.txt:‘Macduff's right,’ said Siward. ‘We can speculate as much as we like but the
Macbeth.txt:issue will only be settled by fighting. So let's go.’
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Five
Macbeth.txt:‘Hang our banners on the outer walls,’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:Seyton snapped his fingers and the soldiers moved about the dark
Macbeth.txt:battlements, hoisting the flags and banners.
Macbeth.txt:‘They're still coming,’ said Macbeth. ‘ Our fortifications will make a mockery of
Macbeth.txt:any siege. Let them sit there until disease and famine destroys them. If they hadn't
Macbeth.txt:been reinforced by my people we'd have met them face to face and pushed them
Macbeth.txt:back to England.’
Macbeth.txt:A long mournful wail went up somewhere inside the castle.
Macbeth.txt:‘What's that noise?’ said Macbeth.
Macbeth.txt:‘The cry of women, my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:Seyton went to find out why they were crying. Macbeth stared over the
Macbeth.txt:battlements to the darkness in front of him. He had almost forgotten what fear was
Macbeth.txt:like. There was a time when he would have shuddered to hear such shrieks in the
Macbeth.txt:night and his scalp would have crawled as though it had life in it. He had indulged in
Macbeth.txt:so much horror that nothing could disturb him any more.
Macbeth.txt:‘What was that about?’ said Macbeth when Seyton returned.
Macbeth.txt:‘The Queen is dead my Lord.’
Macbeth.txt:‘She should have died later. This isn't the time.’
Macbeth.txt:How the days stretched out - each one the same as the one before, and they
Macbeth.txt:would continue to do so, tediously, until the end of history. And every day we have
Macbeth.txt:lived has been the last day of some other fool's life, each day a dot of candle-light
Macbeth.txt:showing him the way to his death-bed. Blow the short candle out: life was no more
Macbeth.txt:than a walking shadow - a poor actor - who goes through all the emotions in one
Macbeth.txt:hour on the stage and then bows out. It was a story told by an idiot, full of noise and
Macbeth.txt:passion, but meaningless.
Macbeth.txt:It was getting light. A young soldier stood behind him, reluctant to deliver his
Macbeth.txt:message.
Macbeth.txt:‘Lost your tongue?’ said Macbeth. ‘ Come on. Out with it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘My gracious Lord,’ said the soldier. ‘ I want to tell you what I think I saw but
Macbeth.txt:don't know how to say it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well just say it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘While I was standing watch on the hill I looked towards Birnam and suddenly I
Macbeth.txt:thought the wood began to move.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Liar!’ said Macbeth. ‘ Rogue!’
Macbeth.txt:‘Be angry with me if I'm lying. It's only three miles away. You can see it: a
Macbeth.txt:moving grove.’
Macbeth.txt:‘If you're lying I'll string you up on the nearest tree. And you'll hang there, alive,
Macbeth.txt:until you shrivel up with starvation. If you're telling the truth I don't care if you do the
Macbeth.txt:same for me. I'm not so sure anymore. I don't believe the fiend that lies with a
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:straight face. 'Fear not, till Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane!' And now a wood is
Macbeth.txt:coming to Dunsinane.’
Macbeth.txt:He placed his hands on either side of his mouth. ‘To arms! To arms!’ he cried.
Macbeth.txt:A drum began to beat and soldiers took up their positions, ready to march out to the
Macbeth.txt:battlefield.
Macbeth.txt:If what the soldier had told him was true there was nowhere he could go - nor
Macbeth.txt:could he stay. He was thoroughly sick of life and wished the world would just come
Macbeth.txt:to an end.
Macbeth.txt:He buckled his breastplate and pulled on his helmet. ‘ Ring the alarm bell!’
Macbeth.txt:Whatever happened - hurricane or ruin - at least he'd die fighting!
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Six
Macbeth.txt:‘This is close enough,’ said Malcolm. ‘ Throw down your branches and reveal
Macbeth.txt:yourselves.’ He called Siward to him. ‘You'll lead the first onslaught, Uncle - you
Macbeth.txt:and your noble son. We and worthy Macduff will follow up, as planned.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Right,’ said Siward. ‘ If we engage with the tyrant's troops tonight, let us be
Macbeth.txt:beaten if we don't fight to the death.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Sound the trumpets!’ cried Macduff.
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Seven
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth surveyed the scene. Most of his men had deserted and corpses lay
Macbeth.txt:everywhere. They'd trapped him. like a bear tied to a stake. he couldn't escape: he
Macbeth.txt:had to stay and fight. But anyway, there was no such thing as a man who wasn't
Macbeth.txt:born of a woman. That was the only thing he had to fear.
Macbeth.txt:Young Siward had spotted him and came towards him. ‘What's your name?’
Macbeth.txt:he said.
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth drew his sword. ‘You'd be terrified to hear it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Never,’ said the young Englishman. ‘Even if you call yourself by a worse
Macbeth.txt:name than any in hell.’
Macbeth.txt:‘My name's Macbeth.’
Macbeth.txt:‘The Devil himself couldn't pronounce a title more hateful to my ear.’
Macbeth.txt:‘No, nor more frightening.’
Macbeth.txt:‘You lie, despicable tyrant! I'll prove that with my sword.’
Macbeth.txt:The young man fought bravely but before long he was lying at Macbeth's feet,
Macbeth.txt:his heart pierced by a king's sword.
Macbeth.txt:‘You were born of woman,’ said Macbeth. ‘But I laugh at swords wielded by
Macbeth.txt:any man that's born of woman.’

Macbeth.txt:If only the tyrant would show his face! If he were to be killed by anyone else his

Macbeth.txt:poor soldiers who had been forced into this. Macbeth was the only one he would
Macbeth.txt:use his sword on. It was either Macbeth or back to its scabbard unused.
Macbeth.txt:He heard a great shout: that's where he'd be. If only he could find him! He'd

Macbeth.txt:down, waiting for them to enter.
Macbeth.txt:‘This way, my Lord,’ said Old Siward. ‘It was a peaceable surrender: the
Macbeth.txt:tyrant's people are fighting each other while the noble thanes have done well in the
Macbeth.txt:battle. It's almost over: there's not much left to do.’
Macbeth.txt:‘We've encountered enemies that have joined us,’ said Malcolm.

Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Eight
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth sat on a hill, ready to fight anyone who dared come near him. He
Macbeth.txt:wasn't going to fall on his sword like a Roman in his situation would have. Why
Macbeth.txt:should he? As long as there were enemies to kill the gashes would look better on
Macbeth.txt:them.
Macbeth.txt:He didn't hear Macduff come up behind him.
Macbeth.txt:‘Turn, hell-hound, turn!’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth turned. ‘Of all men I've avoided you,’ he said. ‘But go away. My soul
Macbeth.txt:is too heavy with your family's blood already.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I've nothing to say,’ said Macduff. ‘My sword is my tongue. You bloodier devil
Macbeth.txt:than words can describe!’
Macbeth.txt:‘You're wasting your time. It'll be easier to dent the air with your sharp sword
Macbeth.txt:than draw my blood. Save your sword for vulnerable chests. My life is charmed. I
Macbeth.txt:can't be killed by anyone who wasn't born of a woman.’ Macbeth turned and began
Macbeth.txt:walking away.
Macbeth.txt:‘Forget your charm,’ said Macduff. ‘And tell the evil spirit who told you that that
Macbeth.txt:Macduff was pulled prematurely from his mother's womb.’
Macbeth.txt:Macbeth whipped round. ‘Curse the tongue that tells me that,’ he said,
Macbeth.txt:‘Because it strikes fear into my heart. And curse these cheating fiends who keep
Macbeth.txt:their promises in small things and deny us our greatest hopes. I won't fight with
Macbeth.txt:you.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Then give yourself up, coward, and live - to be a public spectacle. We'll
Macbeth.txt:advertise you, as we do with our more unusual freaks, with a sign hung from a pole:
Macbeth.txt:'Here you can see they tyrant.’
Macbeth.txt:‘I won't give up to kiss the ground beneath young Malcolm's feet and then be
Macbeth.txt:jeered at by the common rabble.’ Macbeth drew his sword. ‘Even though Birnam
Macbeth.txt:Wood has come to Dunsinane and I'm facing a man not born of woman I'll fight to
Macbeth.txt:the bitter end. Come on, Macduff. And damned be the one who first cries, 'stop - no
Macbeth.txt:more!'‘
Macbeth.txt:
Macbeth.txt:Act Five Scene Nine
Macbeth.txt:‘I wish we hadn't lost so many of our friends,’ said Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘Some men have to die in battle,’ said Siward. ‘For such a famous victory I
Macbeth.txt:think we've been let off lightly.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Macduff's missing, and your noble son.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Your son's been killed my Lord,’ said Ross. ‘He was scarcely a man but he
Macbeth.txt:died like a man.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Dead?’ said Siward.
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, and carried off the field,’ said Ross. ‘Your sorrow musn't be measured by
Macbeth.txt:his worth because if it is it will have no end.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Were his wounds on the front of his body?’
Macbeth.txt:‘Yes, on the front.’
Macbeth.txt:‘Well then, he's God's soldier. And so that's the end of it.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He's worth more grief,’ said Malcolm. ‘And I'll give him that.’
Macbeth.txt:‘He's not,’ said the young man's father. ‘They say he died bravely and did his
Macbeth.txt:duty. And so, God be with him! Look here comes good news!’
Macbeth.txt:It was Macduff. And something hung from his hand. As he came closer,
Macbeth.txt:followed by soldiers of both sides, all cat calling and laughing, they saw that it was a
Macbeth.txt:human head.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hail, King,’ said Macduff. ‘Because that's what you are. Look at the usurper's
Macbeth.txt:head. We're free!’ He took a spear from a sentry, pierced the head and raised it up
Macbeth.txt:above the battlements. ‘I see you're surrounded by the kingdom's finest, all thinking
Macbeth.txt:the words with which I greet you now: Hail, King of Scotland!’
Macbeth.txt:They all knelt in a ring around Malcolm.
Macbeth.txt:‘Hail, King of Scotland!’
Macbeth.txt:‘We won't waste much time in rewarding each and every one of you,’ said the
Macbeth.txt:King. My thanes and cousins, you are now earls - the first earldoms Scotland has
Macbeth.txt:ever awarded. I'm also going to call our exiled friends home and flush out the cruel
Macbeth.txt:agents of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen who, we believe, killed herself.
Macbeth.txt:These things, and whatever else God calls on us to do we'll perform in due course.
Macbeth.txt:So thanks to all and we invite you all to see us crowned at Scone.’

Tempest.txt:OR THE
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:E n c h a n t e d I s l a n d.
Tempest.txt:A COMEDY.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:PREFACE TO THE ENCHANTED ISLAND.
Tempest.txt:The writing of Prefaces to Plays was probably invented by some very
Tempest.txt:ambitious Poet, who never thought he had done enough: Perhaps by some
Tempest.txt:Ape of the French Eloquence, which uses to make a business of a Letter of
Tempest.txt:gallantry, an examen of a Farce; and in short, a great pomp and ostentation
Tempest.txt:of words on every trifle. This is certainly the talent of that Nation, and
Tempest.txt:ought not to be invaded by any other. They do that out of gayety which
Tempest.txt:would be an imposition upon us.
Tempest.txt:We may satisfie our selves with surmounting them in the Scene, and
Tempest.txt:safely leave them those trappings of writing, and flourishes of the Pen, with
Tempest.txt:which they adorn the borders of their Plays, and which are indeed no more
Tempest.txt:than good Landskips to a very indifferent Picture. I must proceed no farther
Tempest.txt:in this argument, lest I run my self beyond my excuse for writing this. Give
Tempest.txt:me leave therefore to tell you, Reader, that I do it not to set a value on any
Tempest.txt:thing I have written in this Play, but out of gratitude to the memory of Sir
Tempest.txt:William Davenant, who did me the honour to joyn me with him in the
Tempest.txt:alteration of it.
Tempest.txt:It was originally Shakespear’s: a Poet for whom he had particularly a
Tempest.txt:high veneration, and whom he first taught me to admire. The Play it self
Tempest.txt:had formerly been acted with success in the Black-Fryers: and our excellent
Tempest.txt:Fletcher had so great a value for it, that he thought fit to make use of the
Tempest.txt:same Design, not much varied, a second time. Those who have seen his SeaVoyage, may easily discern that it was a Copy of Shakespear’s Tempest: the
Tempest.txt:Storm, the desart Island, and the Woman who had never seen a Man, are
Tempest.txt:all sufficient testimonies of it. But Fletcher was not the only Poet who made
Tempest.txt:use of Shakespear’s Plot: Sir John Suckling, a profess’d admirer of our
Tempest.txt:Author, has follow’d his footsteps in his Goblins; his Regmella being an
Tempest.txt:open imitation of Shakespear’s Miranda; and his Spirits, though
Tempest.txt:counterfeit, yet are copied from Ariel. But Sir William Davenant, as he was
Tempest.txt:a man of quick and piercing imagination, soon sound that somewhat might
Tempest.txt:be added to the Design of Shakespear, of which neither Fletcher nor
Tempest.txt:Suckling had ever thought: and therefore to put the last hand to it, he
Tempest.txt:design’d the Counterpart to Shakespear’s Plot, namely that of a Man who
Tempest.txt:had never seen a Woman; that by this means those two Characters of
Tempest.txt:Innocence and Love might the more illustrate and commend each other.

Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:The Tempest
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:This excellent contrivance he was pleas’d to communicate to me, and to
Tempest.txt:desire my assistance in it. I confess that from the very first moment it so
Tempest.txt:pleas’d me, that I never writ any thing with more delight. I must likewise do
Tempest.txt:him that justice to acknowledge, that my writing received daily his
Tempest.txt:amendments, and that is the reason why it is not so faulty, as the rest which
Tempest.txt:I have done without the help or correction of so judicious a friend. The
Tempest.txt:Comical parts of the Saylors were also his invention, and for the most part
Tempest.txt:his writing, as you will easily discover by the style. In the time I writ with
Tempest.txt:him I had the opportunity to observe somewhat more neerly of him than I
Tempest.txt:had formerly done, when I had only a bare acquaintance with him: I found
Tempest.txt:him then of so quick a fancy, that nothing was propos’d to him, on which
Tempest.txt:he could not suddenly produce a thought extreamly pleasant and
Tempest.txt:surprizing: and those first thoughts of his, contrary to the old Latine
Tempest.txt:Proverb, were not alwaies the least happy. And as his fancy was quick, so
Tempest.txt:likewise were the products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any
Tempest.txt:other; and his imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any
Tempest.txt:other man. His corrections were sober and judicious: and he corrected his
Tempest.txt:own writings much more severely than those of another man, bestowing
Tempest.txt:twice the time and labour in polishing which he us’d in invention. It had
Tempest.txt:perhaps been easie enough for me to have arrogated more to my self than
Tempest.txt:was my due in the writing of this Play, and to have pass’d by his name with
Tempest.txt:silence in the publication of it, with the same ingratitude which others have
Tempest.txt:us’d to him, whose Writings he hath not only corrected, as he has done this,
Tempest.txt:but has had a greater inspection over them, and sometimes added whole
Tempest.txt:Scenes together, which may as easily be distinguish’d from the rest, as true
Tempest.txt:Gold from counterfeit by the weight. But besides the unworthiness of the
Tempest.txt:action which deterred me from it (there being nothing so base as to rob the
Tempest.txt:dead of his reputation) I am satisfi’d I could never have receiv’d so much
Tempest.txt:honour in being thought the Author of any Poem how excellent soever, as
Tempest.txt:I shall from the joining my imperfections with the merit and name of
Tempest.txt:Shakespear and Sir William Davenant.

Tempest.txt:As when a Tree’s cut down the secret root
Tempest.txt:Lives under ground, and thence new Branches shoot
Tempest.txt:So, from old Shakespear’s honour’d dust, this day
Tempest.txt:Springs up and buds a new reviving Play.
Tempest.txt:Shakespear, who (taught by none) did first impart
Tempest.txt:To Fletcher Wit, to labouring Johnson Art.
Tempest.txt:He, Monarch-like, gave those his subjects law,
Tempest.txt:And is that Nature which they paint and draw.
Tempest.txt:Fletcher reach’d that which on his heights did grow,
Tempest.txt:Whilst Johnson crept and gather’d all below.
Tempest.txt:This did his Love, and this his Mirth digest:
Tempest.txt:One imitates him most, the other best.
Tempest.txt:If they have since out-writ all other men,
Tempest.txt:’Tis with the drops which fell from Shakespear’s Pen.
Tempest.txt:The Storm which vanish’d on the Neighb’ring shore,
Tempest.txt:Was taught by Shakespear’s Tempest first to roar.
Tempest.txt:That innocence and beauty which did smile
Tempest.txt:In Fletcher, grew on this Enchanted Isle.
Tempest.txt:But Shakespear’s Magick could not copy’d be,
Tempest.txt:Within that Circle none durst walk but he.
Tempest.txt:I must confess ’twas bold, nor would you now,
Tempest.txt:That liberty to vulgar Wits allow,
Tempest.txt:Which works by Magick supernatural things:
Tempest.txt:But Shakespear’s pow’r is sacred as a King’s.
Tempest.txt:Those Legends from old Priest-hood were receiv’d,
Tempest.txt:And he then writ, as people then believ’d.
Tempest.txt:But, if for Shakespear we your grace implore,
Tempest.txt:We for our Theatre shall want it more:
Tempest.txt:Who by our dearth of Youths are forc’d t’employ
Tempest.txt:One of our Women to present a Boy.
Tempest.txt:And that’s a transformation you will say
Tempest.txt:Exceeding all the Magick in the Play.
Tempest.txt:Let none expect in the last Act to find,
Tempest.txt:Her Sex transform’d from man to Woman-kind.
Tempest.txt:What e’re she was before the Play began,
Tempest.txt:All you shall see of her is perfect man.
Tempest.txt:Or if your fancy will be farther led,
Tempest.txt:To find her Woman, it must be abed.

Tempest.txt:This floating Ram did bear his Horns above;
Tempest.txt:All ty’d with Ribbands, russling in the wind,
Tempest.txt:Sometimes he nodded down his head a while,
Tempest.txt:And then the Waves did heave him to the Moon;
Tempest.txt:He clamb’ring to the top of all the Billows,
Tempest.txt:And then again he curtsy’d down so low,
Tempest.txt:I could not see him: till, at last, all side long
Tempest.txt:With a great crack his belly burst in pieces.

Tempest.txt:In this great Creature there were other Creatures,
Tempest.txt:And shortly we may chance to see that thing,
Tempest.txt:Which you have heard my Father call, a Man.
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:But what is that? for yet he never told me.

Tempest.txt:Methinks indeed it would be finer, if we two
Tempest.txt:Had two young Fathers.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:No Sister, no, if they were young, my Father
Tempest.txt:Said that we must call them Brothers.
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:But pray how does it come that we two are not Brothers then, and have not
Tempest.txt:Beards like him?
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Now I confess you pose me.
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:How did he come to be our Father too?
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I think he found us when we both were little, and grew within the ground.
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:Why could he not find more of us? pray sister let you and I look up and
Tempest.txt:down one day, to find some little ones for us to play with.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:[450] Agreed; but now we must go in. This is the hour
Tempest.txt:Wherein my Father’s Charm will work,
Tempest.txt:Which seizes all who are in open Air:
Tempest.txt:Th’ effect of his great Art I long to see,
Tempest.txt:Which will perform as much as Magick can.

Tempest.txt:I think you cannot tell who is your friend!
Tempest.txt:Open your chops, I say.

Tempest.txt:to turn civil and sober, as I am? for then thou shalt be my subject.
Tempest.txt:CALIBAN
Tempest.txt:I’le swear upon that Bottle to be true; for the liquor [325] is not Earthly:
Tempest.txt:did’st thou not drop from Heaven?
Tempest.txt:TRINCALO

Tempest.txt:O gentle Youth, Fate waits for thee abroad,
Tempest.txt:A black Star threatens thee, and death unseen

Tempest.txt:Enter Prospero alone.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:’Tis not yet fit to let my Daughters know I kept
Tempest.txt:The infant Duke of Mantua so near them in this Isle,

Tempest.txt:Till my false Brother (when he design’d t’usurp
Tempest.txt:My Dukedom from me) expos’d him to that fate
Tempest.txt:He meant for me. By calculation of his birth
Tempest.txt:[375] I saw death threat’ning him, if, till some time were
Tempest.txt:Past, he should behold the face of any Woman:

Tempest.txt:Heav’n knows, and thou thy self canst bear me witness,
Tempest.txt:Therefore accuse not me for thy restraint.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:But here are creatures which I nam’d not to thee,
Tempest.txt:Who share man’s soveraignty by Nature’s Laws,
Tempest.txt:And oft depose him from it.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:What are those Creatures, Sir?
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:Those dangerous enemies of men call’d women.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:[400] Women! I never heard of them before.
Tempest.txt:But have I Enemies within this Isle, and do you

Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:O they despise old age, and spare it for that reason:
Tempest.txt:It is below their conquest, their fury falls
Tempest.txt:Alone upon the young.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Why then the fury of the young should fall on them again.
Tempest.txt:Pray turn me loose upon ’em: but, good Sir,
Tempest.txt:What are women like?
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:Imagine something between young men and Angels:
Tempest.txt:Fatally beauteous, and have killing Eyes,
Tempest.txt:Their voices charm beyond the Nightingales,
Tempest.txt:They are all enchantment, those who once behold ’em,
Tempest.txt:Are made their slaves for ever.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Then I will wink and fight with ’em.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:’Tis but in vain, for when your eyes are shut,

Tempest.txt:They’l haunt you in your very sleep.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Then I’le revenge it on ’em when I wake.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:You are without all possibility of revenge,
Tempest.txt:[425] They are so beautiful that you can ne’re attempt,
Tempest.txt:Nor wish to hurt them.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Are they so beautiful?
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:Calm sleep is not so soft, nor Winter Suns,
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:The Tempest
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:41
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:Nor Summer Shades so pleasant.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Can they be fairer than the Plumes of Swans?
Tempest.txt:Or more delightful than the Peacocks Feathers?
Tempest.txt:Or than the gloss upon the necks of Doves?
Tempest.txt:Or have more various beauty than the Rain-bow?
Tempest.txt:These I have seen, and without danger wondred at.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:All these are far below ’em. Nature made
Tempest.txt:Nothing but Woman dangerous and fair:
Tempest.txt:Therefore if you should chance to see ’em,
Tempest.txt:Avoid ’em streight, I charge you.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Well, since you say they are so dangerous,
Tempest.txt:I’le so far shun ’em as I may with safety of the
Tempest.txt:Unblemish’d honour which you taught me.
Tempest.txt:But let ’em not provoke me, for I’m sure I shall
Tempest.txt:Not then forbear them.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO

Tempest.txt:Tomorrow I may bring you better news.

Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:[Exit Hippolito.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:So, so; I hope this lesson has secur’d him,
Tempest.txt:For I have been constrain’d to change his Lodging
Tempest.txt:From yonder Rock where first I bred him up,
Tempest.txt:[450] And here have brought him home to my own Cell,
Tempest.txt:Because the Shipwrack happen’d near his Mansion.
Tempest.txt:I hope he will not stir beyond his limits,
Tempest.txt:For hither he hath been all obedience;

Tempest.txt:And yet there is one sullen cloud behind,
Tempest.txt:I would it were disperst.

Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Oh me, why stay we here then?
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:I’le keep far enough from his Den, I warrant him.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA

Tempest.txt:DORINDA

Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:[475] No, they are wild within Doors, in Chambers,

Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:Come, Sister, shall we walk the other way,
Tempest.txt:The man will catch us else, we have but two legs,
Tempest.txt:And he perhaps has four.

Tempest.txt:If he would hurt me, yet he knows not how:
Tempest.txt:He hath no Claws, nor Teeth, nor Horns to hurt me,

Tempest.txt:This is hard.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:It is the way to make him love you more;
Tempest.txt:He will despise you if you grow too kind.
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:I’le struggle with my heart to follow this,
Tempest.txt:But if I lose him by it, will you promise
Tempest.txt:To bring him back agen?

Tempest.txt:Yes such a one, who for his sweetness and his goodly shape, (if I, who am
Tempest.txt:unskill’d in forms, may judge) I think can scarce be equall’d: ’Tis a youth,
Tempest.txt:a Stranger too as you are.
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:Of such a graceful feature, and must I for your sake love?
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Yes, Sir, do you scruple to grant the first request I ever made? he’s wholly
Tempest.txt:unacquainted with the world, and wants [75] your conversation. You should
Tempest.txt:have compassion on so meer a stranger.
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:Those need compassion whom you discommend, not whom you praise.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:Did I not love, I could no more endure this undeserved captivity, then I
Tempest.txt:could wish to gain my freedom with the loss of you.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I only ask this easie tryal of you.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I am a fool to weep at what I’m glad of: but I have a suit to you, and that,
Tempest.txt:Sir, shall be now the only tryal of your love.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:Perhaps it might have easier bin
Tempest.txt:If you had never ask’d it.
Tempest.txt:

Tempest.txt:o’rebid the price of all that humane life is worth.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I cannot understand you; and methinks am loth
Tempest.txt:To be more knowing.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Sir, ’tis to love one for my sake, who for his own deserves all the respect

Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I fear I have offended you, and yet I meant no harm:
Tempest.txt:But if you please to hear me—
Tempest.txt:Heark! Sir! now I am sure my Father comes, I know
Tempest.txt:His steps; dear Love retire a while, I fear
Tempest.txt:I’ve stay’d too long.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:If that be all you doubt, trust me for him.
Tempest.txt:He has a melting heart, and soft to all the Seals
Tempest.txt:Of kindness; I will undertake for his compassion.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:[A noise within.

Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Come, you must love him for my sake: you shall.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:He appears displeas’d with that young man, I know
Tempest.txt:Not why: but, till I find from whence his hate proceeds,
Tempest.txt:I must conceal it from my Fathers knowledge,
Tempest.txt:For he will think that guiltless I have caus’d it;
Tempest.txt:And suffer me no more to see my Love.
Tempest.txt:[Enter Prospero.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:Must I for yours, and cannot for my own?
Tempest.txt:Either you do not love, or think that I do not:
Tempest.txt:But when you bid me love him, I must hate him.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:Now I have been indulgent to your wish,
Tempest.txt:You have seen the Prisoner?
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:Have I so far offended you already,
Tempest.txt:That he offends you only for my sake?
Tempest.txt:Yet sure you would not hate him, if you saw
Tempest.txt:Him as I have done, so full of youth and beauty.
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:O poyson to my hopes!
Tempest.txt:[100] When he did visit me, and I did mention this
Tempest.txt:eauteous Creature to him, he did then tell me
Tempest.txt:He would have her.

Tempest.txt:[125] Yes.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:[Aside.

Tempest.txt:Alas, what mean you?
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:How like you his converse?
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:FERDINAND
Tempest.txt:It is too plain: like most of her frail Sex, she’s false,
Tempest.txt:But has not learnt the art to hide it;
Tempest.txt:Nature has done her part, she loves variety:
Tempest.txt:Why did I think that any Woman could be innocent,
Tempest.txt:Because she’s young? No, no, their Nurses teach them
Tempest.txt:Change, when with two Nipples they divide their
Tempest.txt:Liking.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:At second sight
Tempest.txt:A man does not appear so rare a Creature.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO ASIDE
Tempest.txt:I find she loves him much because she hides it.
Tempest.txt:Love teaches cunning even to innocence,
Tempest.txt:And where he gets possession, his first work is to
Tempest.txt:Dig deep within a heart, and there lie hid,
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:84
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:Dryden and Davenant
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:And like a Miser in the dark to feast alone.
Tempest.txt:But tell me, dear Miranda, how does he suffer
Tempest.txt:His imprisonment?
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:I think he seems displeas’d.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:O then ’tis plain his temper is not noble,
Tempest.txt:For the brave with equal minds bear good
Tempest.txt:And evil fortune.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:O, Sir, but he’s pleas’d again so soon
Tempest.txt:That ’tis not worth your noting.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:To be soon displeas’d and pleas’d so suddenly again,
Tempest.txt:Does shew him of a various froward Nature.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:The truth is, Sir, he was not vex’d at all, but only
Tempest.txt:Seem’d to be so.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO
Tempest.txt:If he be not and yet seems angry, he is a dissembler,
Tempest.txt:Which shews the worst of Natures.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:[150] Truly, Sir, the man has faults enough; but in my conscience that’s none
Tempest.txt:of ’em. He can be no dissembler.
Tempest.txt:PROSPERO ASIDE
Tempest.txt:How she excuses him, and yet desires that I should judge her heart
Tempest.txt:indifferent to him? well, since his faults are many, I am glad you love him
Tempest.txt:not.
Tempest.txt:MIRANDA
Tempest.txt:’Tis like, Sir, they are many,
Tempest.txt:But I know none he has, yet let me often see him
Tempest.txt:And I shall find ’em all in time.

Tempest.txt:Sir, when I saw you first, I through my eyes drew
Tempest.txt:Something in, I know not what it is;

Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:You need not care, you’l have my Sisters hand.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:Why, must not he who touches hers touch yours?
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:You mean to love her too.

Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:My Sister told me she had seen another;
Tempest.txt:A man like you, and she lik’d only him;
Tempest.txt:Therefore if one must be enough for her,
Tempest.txt:He is that one, and then you cannot have her.
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:If she like him, she may like both of us.

Tempest.txt:[Aside.
Tempest.txt:
Tempest.txt:DORINDA
Tempest.txt:But how if I should change and like that man?
Tempest.txt:Would you be willing to permit that change?
Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO
Tempest.txt:No, for you lik’d me first.

Tempest.txt:HIPPOLITO

He found classrooms, televisions, theatres, cinemas. Speaking us plays, Shakespeare comments life culture, well own. Actors still regularly perform plays modern stage screen. The 1990s, example, saw release cinematic versions Romeo Juliet, Hamlet, Othello, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, many works. Anti-Stratfordians — modern scholars question authorship Shakespeare’s plays — used lack information argue William Shakespeare either never existed or, exist, write plays attribute him. They believe another historical figure, Francis Bacon Queen Elizabeth I, used name cover. Whether man named William Shakespeare ever actually existed ultimately secondary recognition group plays bound together name exist continues educate, enlighten, entertain us. In addition popularity Shakespeare’s plays wrote them, writers modernized works attract new audiences. For example, West Side Story places Romeo Juliet New York City, A Thousand Acres sets King Lear Iowa corn country. Beyond adaptations productions, life works captured cultural imagination. The twentieth century witnessed production play two minor characters Shakespeare’s Hamlet Rosencrantz Guildenstern Dead fictional movie Shakespeare’s early life poetic inspiration Shakespeare Love. Despite monumental presence culture, Shakespeare remains enigmatic. He tell us plays wrote alone, plays collaborated playwrights, versions plays read perform. Furthermore, handful documents available life, tell us much Shakespeare person, forcing critics scholars look historical references uncover true-life great dramatist.

Culver Pictures, Inc./SuperStock 2 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Family life Though scholars unsure exact date Shakespeare’s birth, records indicate parents — Mary John Shakespeare — baptized April 26, 1564, small provincial town Stratford-upon-Avon — named sat banks Avon river. Because common practice baptize infants days born, scholars generally recognize April 23, 1564, Shakespeare’s birthday. Coincidentally, April 23 day St. George, patron saint England, well day upon Shakespeare would die 52 years later. William third Mary John’s eight children first four sons. The house scholars believe Shakespeare born stands Henley Street and, despite many modifications years, still visit today. Shakespeare’s father Prior Shakespeare’s birth, John Shakespeare lived Snitterfield, married Mary Arden, daughter landlord. After moving Stratford 1552, worked glover, moneylender, dealer agricultural products wool grain. He also pursued public office achieved variety posts including bailiff, Stratford’s highest elected position — equivalent small town’s mayor. At height career, sometime near 1576, petitioned Herald’s Office coat arms thus right gentleman. But rise middle class gentry come right away, costly petition expired without granted. About time, John Shakespeare mysteriously fell financial difficulty. He became involved serious litigation, assessed heavy fines, even lost seat town council. Some scholars suggest decline could resulted religious discrimination Shakespeare family may supported Catholicism, practice illegal England. However, Shakespeare’s birthplace. SuperStock scholars point religious dissenters (both Catholics radical Puritans) lost posts due religion. Whatever cause decline, John regain prosperity toward end life. In 1596, Herald’s Office granted Shakespeare family coat arms petition William, successful playwright London. And John, prior death 1601, regained seat Stratford’s town council. Childhood education Our understanding William Shakespeare’s childhood Stratford primarily speculative children often appear legal records many scholars attempt reconstruct Shakespeare’s life. Based father’s local prominence, scholars speculate Shakespeare likely attended King’s New School, school usually employed Oxford graduates generally well respected. Shakespeare would started petty school — rough equivalent modern preschool — age four five. He would learned read hornbook, sheet parchment paper alphabet Lord’s Prayer written. This sheet framed wood covered transparent piece horn durability.

Judith. Hamnet died age 11 Shakespeare primarily living away family London. While grammar school, Shakespeare would primarily studied Latin, reciting reading works classical Roman authors Plautus, Ovid, Seneca, Horace. Traces authors’ works seen dramatic texts. Toward last years grammar school, Shakespeare would acquired basic skills Greek well. Thus remark made Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s well-educated friend contemporary playwright, Shakespeare knew “small Latin less Greek” accurate. Jonson saying Shakespeare left grammar school semiliterate; merely indicates Shakespeare attend University, would gained Latin Greek instruction. For seven years twins’ baptism, records remain silent Shakespeare. At point, traveled London became involved theatre, could anywhere 21 28 years old did. Though suggested may served assistant schoolmaster provincial school, seems likely went London become actor, gradually becoming playwright gaining attention. Wife children When Shakespeare became adult, historical records documenting existence began increase. In November 1582, age 18, married 26year-old Anne Hathaway nearby village Shottery. The disparity ages, coupled fact baptized first daughter, Susanna, six months later May 1583, caused great deal modern speculation nature relationship. However, sixteenth-century conceptions marriage differed slightly modern notions. Though marriages needed performed member clergy, many Shakespeare’s contemporaries believed couple could establish relationship premarital contract exchanging vows front witnesses. This contract removed social stigma pregnancy marriage. (Shakespeare’s plays contain instances marriage prompted pregnancy, Measure Measure includes kind premarital contract.) Two years later, February 1585, Shakespeare baptized twins Hamnet The plays: On stage print The next mention Shakespeare comes 1592 University wit named Robert Greene Shakespeare apparently already rising actor playwright London stage.

This statement comes point time men without university education, like Shakespeare, starting compete dramatists University wits. As many critics pointed out, Greene’s statement recalls line 3 Henry VI, reads, “O tiger’s heart wrapped woman’s hide!” (I.4.137). Greene’s remark indicate Shakespeare generally disliked. On contrary, another University wit, Thomas Nashe, wrote great theatrical success Henry VI, Henry Chettle, Greene’s publisher, later printed flattering apology Shakespeare.

He would probably thought plays belonging company. For reason, scholars generally characterized quartos printed Folio “bad” arguing printers pirated plays published illegally. How would printer received pirated copy play? The theories range someone stealing copy actor (or actors) selling play relating memory printer. Many times, major differences exist quarto version play folio version, causing uncertainty Shakespeare’s true creation. Hamlet, example, almost twice long Folio quarto versions. Recently, scholars come realize value different versions.

Introduction William Shakespeare A note Shakespeare’s language 7 Readers encountering Shakespeare first time usually find Early Modern English difficult understand. Yet, rather serving barrier Shakespeare, richness language form part appreciation Bard. Shakespeare often employs puns way illustrating distance surface — apparent meanings — meanings lie underneath. Though recognizing puns may difficult first, notes far right column point many you. One first things readers usually notice language use pronouns. Like King James Version Bible, Shakespeare’s pronouns slightly different cause confusion. Words like “thou” (you), “thee” “ye” (objective cases you), “thy” “thine” (your/yours) appear throughout Shakespeare’s plays. You may need little time get used changes. You find definitions words commonly cause confusion glossary column right side page edition. If encountering Shakespeare’s plays first time, following reading tips may help ease plays. Shakespeare’s lines meant spoken; therefore, reading aloud speaking help comprehension. Also, though lines poetic, forget read complete sentences — move period period well line line. Although Shakespeare’s language difficult first, rewards immersing richness fluidity lines immeasurable. Iambic pentameter Though Shakespeare sometimes wrote prose, wrote plays poetry, specifically blank verse. Blank verse consists lines unrhymed iambic pentameter. Iambic refers stress patterns line. An iamb element sound consists two beats — first unstressed (da) second stressed (DA). A good example iambic line Hamlet’s famous line “To be,” stress “To,” “or,” “to,” stress “be,” “not,” “be.” Pentameter refers meter number stressed syllables line. Pentameter five stressed syllables. Thus, Romeo’s line “But soft, light yonder window breaks?” (II.2.2) good example iambic pentameter line. Wordplay Shakespeare’s language also verbally rich he, along many dramatists period, fondness wordplay.

The term renaissance, meaning rebirth, applied period English history way celebrating perceived rapid development art, literature, science, politics: many ways, rebirth classical Rome. Recently, scholars challenged name “English Renaissance” two grounds. First, scholars argue term used women share advancements English culture time period; legal status still men. Second, scholars challenged basic notion period saw sudden explosion culture. A rebirth civilization suggests previous period time civilized. This second group scholars sees much gradual transition Middle Ages Shakespeare’s time. Some people use terms Elizabethan Jacobean referring periods sixteenth seventeenth centuries. These terms correspond reigns Elizabeth I (1558–1603) James I (1603–1625). The problem terms cover large spans time; example, Shakespeare’s life career spans monarchies. Scholars beginning replace Renaissance term Early Modern referring time period, people still use terms interchangeably. The term Early Modern recognizes period established many foundations modern culture. Though critics still disagree exact dates period, general, dates range 1450 1750. Thus, Shakespeare’s life clearly falls within Early Modern period. Shakespeare’s plays live culture, must remember Shakespeare’s culture differed greatly own. Though understanding human nature relationships seems apply modern lives, must try understand world lived better understand plays. This introduction helps that. It examines intellectual, religious, political, social contexts Shakespeare’s work turning importance theatre printing press. Intellectual context In general, people Early Modern England looked universe, human body, science differently way do. But share beliefs, must think people Shakespeare’s time lacking intelligence education. Discoveries made Early Modern period concerning universe human body provide basis modern science. Cosmology One subject view differently Early Modern thinkers cosmology. Shakespeare’s contemporaries believed astronomy Ptolemy, intellectual Alexandria second century A.D. Ptolemy thought earth stood center universe, surrounded nine concentric rings. The celestial bodies circled earth following order: moon, Mercury, Venus, sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, stars. The entire system controlled primum mobile, Prime Mover, initiated maintained movement celestial bodies. No one yet discovered last three planets solar system, Uranus, Neptune Pluto. In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus published theory sun-based solar system, sun stood center planets revolved around it. Though theory appeared prior Introduction Early Modern England Shakespeare’s birth, people didn’t really start change minds 1610, Galileo used telescope confirm Copernicus’ theory. David Bevington asserts general introduction edition Shakespeare’s works Shakespeare’s writing career, cosmology universe question, sense uncertainty influences plays. Universal hierarchy Closely related Ptolemy’s hierarchical view universe hierarchical conception Earth (sometimes referred Chain Being). During Early Modern period, many people believed creation organized hierarchically. God existed top, followed angels, men, women, animals, plants, rocks. (Because women thought exist men chain, easily imagine confusion Elizabeth I caused became queen England. She literally “out order,” expression still exists society.) Though concept hierarchy useful one beginning study Shakespeare, keep mind distinctions hierarchical view always clear reduce Early Modern thinking simple chain. Elements humors The belief hierarchical scheme existence created comforting sense order balance carried science well. Shakespeare’s contemporaries generally accepted four different elements composed everything universe: earth, air, water, fire. People associated four elements four qualities being. These qualities — hot, cold, moist, dry — appeared different combinations elements. For example, air hot moist; water cold moist; earth cold dry; fire hot dry. 9 In addition, people believed human body contained four elements form humors — blood, phlegm, yellow bile, black bile — corresponded element. Blood corresponded air (hot moist), phlegm water (cold moist), yellow bile fire (hot dry), black bile earth (cold dry). When someone sick, physicians generally believed patient’s humors proper balance. For example, someone diagnosed abundance blood, physician would bleed patient (using leeches cutting skin) order restore balance. Shakespeare’s contemporaries also believed humors determined personality temperament. If person’s dominant humor blood, considered lighthearted. If dominated yellow bile (or choler), person irritable. The dominance phlegm led person dull kind. And black bile prevailed, melancholy sad. Thus, people Early Modern England often used humors explain behavior emotional outbursts. Throughout Shakespeare’s plays, uses concept humors define explain various characters. In play Julius Caesar, humors referred several occasions. For example, Act IV, Scene 3, famous “quarrel scene,” Brutus accuses testy Cassius “rash choler.” Religious context Shakespeare lived England full religious uncertainty dispute. From Protestant Reformation translation Bible English, Early Modern era punctuated events greatly influenced modern religious beliefs. The Reformation Until Protestant Reformation, Christian church Catholic, “universal,” church. 10 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Beginning Europe early sixteenth century, religious thinkers Martin Luther John Calvin, claimed Roman Catholic Church become corrupt longer following word God, began become known Protestant Reformation. The Protestants (“protestors”) believed salvation faith rather works. They also believed primacy Bible advocated giving people access reading Bible. Henry’s petitions divorce, forcing divorce Catherine without Church’s approval, 1533. The Act Supremacy The following year, Pope excommunicated Henry VIII Parliament confirmed divorce legitimacy new marriage Act Succession. Later 1534, Parliament passed Act Supremacy, naming Henry “Supreme Head Church England.” Henry continued persecute radical Protestant reformers Catholics remained loyal Rome. Henry VIII’s death 1547 brought Edward VI, 10-year-old son Jane Seymour (the king’s third wife), throne. This succession gave Protestant reformers chance solidify break Catholic Church. During Edward’s reign, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer established foundation Anglican Church 42 articles religion. He also wrote first Book Common Prayer, adopted 1549, official text worship services England. A portrait King Henry VIII, artist unknown, ca. 1542. National Portrait Gallery, London/SuperStock Many English people initially resisted Protestant ideas. However, Reformation England began 1527 reign Henry VIII, prior Shakespeare’s birth. In year, Henry VIII decided divorce wife, Catherine Aragon, failure produce male heir. (Only one children, Mary, survived past infancy.) Rome denied Bloody Mary Catholics continued persecuted 1553, sickly Edward VI died succeeded Mary, half-sister Catholic daughter Catherine Aragon. The reign Mary witnessed reversal religion England restoration Catholic authority obedience Rome. Protestants executed large numbers, earned monarch nickname “Bloody Mary.” Many Protestants fled Europe escape persecution. Elizabeth, daughter Henry VIII Anne Boleyn, outwardly complied mandated Catholicism half-sister Mary’s reign, restored Protestantism took throne 1558 Mary’s death. Thus, space Introduction Early Modern England single decade, England’s throne passed Protestant Catholic Protestant, change carrying serious deadly consequences. Though Elizabeth reigned relative peace 1558 death 1603, religion still serious concern subjects. During Shakespeare’s life, great deal religious dissent existed England. Many Catholics, remained loyal Rome church, persecuted beliefs. At end spectrum, Puritans persecuted belief Reformation complete. (The English pejoratively applied term Puritan religious groups wanted continue purifying English church measures removing episcopacy, structure bishops.) The Great Bible One thing agreed upon Anglicans Puritans importance Bible written English. Translated William Tyndale 1525, first authorized Bible English, published 1539, known Great Bible. This Bible later revised Elizabeth’s reign known Bishop’s Bible. As Stephen Greenblatt points introduction Norton Shakespeare, Shakespeare would probably familiar Bishop’s Bible, heard aloud Mass, Geneva Bible, written English exiles Geneva. The last authorized Bible produced Shakespeare’s lifetime came within last decade life James I’s commissioned edition, known King James Bible, appeared 1611. 11 Elizabeth I Despite Protestant, Elizabeth I tried take middle road religious question. She allowed Catholics practice religion private long outwardly appeared Anglican remained loyal throne. Elizabeth’s monarchy one absolute supremacy. Believing divine right kings, styled appointed God rule England. To oppose Queen’s equivalent opposing God’s will. Known passive obedience, doctrine allow opposition even tyrannical monarch God appointed king queen reasons unknown His subjects earth. However, Bevington notes, Elizabeth’s power absolute rhetoric suggested. Parliament, already well established England, reserved power, authority levy taxes, itself. Political context Politics religion closely related Shakespeare’s England. Both monarchs Shakespeare lived deal religious political dissenters. A portrait Elizabeth I George Gower, ca. 1588. National Portrait Gallery, London/SuperStock 12 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Elizabeth I lived society restricted women possessing political personal autonomy power. As queen, Elizabeth violated called question many prejudices practices women. In way, society forced “overcome” sex order rule effectively. However, position nothing increase status women England. One rhetorical strategies Elizabeth adopted order rule effectively separate position monarch England natural body — separate body politic body natural. In addition, throughout reign, Elizabeth brilliantly negotiated domestic foreign factions — anxious female monarch wanted marry — appeasing sides without ever committing one. She remained unmarried throughout 45-year reign, partially styling Virgin Queen whose purity represented England herself. Her refusal marry habit hinting promising marriage suitors foreign domestic helped Elizabeth maintain internal external peace. Not marrying allowed retain independence, left succession English throne question. In 1603, deathbed, named James VI, King Scotland son cousin Mary, successor. James I When assumed English crown, James VI Scotland became James I England. (Some historians refer James VI I.) Like Elizabeth, James strong believer divine right kings absolute authority. Upon arrival London claim English throne, James made plans unite Scotland England clear. However, long-standing history enmity existed two countries. Partially result history influx Scottish courtiers English society, anti-Scottish prejudice abounded England. When James asked Parliament title “King Great Britain,” denied. As scholars Bevington pointed out, James less successful Elizabeth negotiating different religious political factions England. Although Protestant, began problems Puritan sect House Commons, ultimately led rift court (which also started Catholic sympathies) Parliament. This rift monarchy Parliament eventually escalated civil war would erupt reign James’s son, Charles I. In spite difficulties Parliament, James’ court site wealth, luxury, extravagance. James I commissioned elaborate feasts, masques, pageants, doubled royal debt. Stephen Greenblatt suggests Shakespeare’s The Tempest may reflect extravagance Prospero’s magnificent banquet accompanying masque. Reigning 1603 1625, James I remained King England throughout last years Shakespeare’s life. Social context Shakespeare’s England divided roughly two social classes: aristocrats (or nobility) everyone else. The primary distinctions two classes ancestry, wealth, power. Simply put, aristocrats ones possessed three. Aristocrats born wealth, growth trade development skilled professions began provide wealth born it. Although notion middle class begin develop Shakespeare’s death, possibility social mobility exist Introduction Early Modern England 13 Early Modern England. Shakespeare used wealth gained theatre move lower ranks aristocracy securing coat arms family. Furthermore, women generally receive education could enter certain professions, including acting. Instead, society relegated women domestic sphere home. Shakespeare unique movement, people received opportunity increase social status. Members aristocracy feared social movement and, result, promoted harsh laws apprenticeship fashion, restricting certain styles dress material. These laws dictated aristocracy could wear certain articles clothing, colors, materials. Though enforcement difficult task, Early Modern aristocracy considered dressing one’s station moral ethical violation. Although two women Julius Caesar, Brutus’ wife, Portia, gives reader interesting look Roman women Elizabethan eyes. In Act II, Scene 1, Portia concerned husband’s recent erratic behavior. Instead remaining silent, complacent wife, Portia confronts husband, asking Brutus treat respected equal revealing secrets her. She reminds honorable constant woman, strong enough bear anything husband may reveal her. Brutus eventually tells Portia plans, Act II, Scene 4, burdens secrets, Portia laments, “how weak thing / The heart woman is.” Frantic betray husband, Portia complains “a man’s mind, woman’s might. / How hard women keep counsel.” The status women The legal status women allow much public private autonomy. English society functioned system patriarchy hierarchy (see “Universal hierarchy” earlier introduction), means men controlled society beginning individual family. In fact, family metaphorically corresponded state. For example, husband king family. His authority control family absolute based divine right, similar country’s king. People also saw family differently today, considering apprentices servants part whole family. The practice primogeniture — system inheritance passed family’s wealth first male child — accompanied system patriarchy. Thus women generally inherit family’s wealth titles. In absence male heir, women, Queen Elizabeth, did. But women married, lost almost already limited legal rights, right inherit, property, sign contracts. In likelihood, Elizabeth I would lost much power authority married. Daily life Daily life Early Modern England began sun-up — exactly early depended one’s station life. A servant’s responsibilities usually included preparing house day. Families usually possessed limited living space, even among wealthy families multiple family members tended share small number rooms, suggesting privacy may important practical. Working morning, Elizabethans usually lunch noon. This midday meal primary meal day, much like dinner modern families. The workday usually ended around sundown 5:00 p.m., depending season. Before early bedtime, Elizabethans usually ate light repast settled couple hours reading (if family members literate could bear high cost books) socializing. 14 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Mortality rates Mortality rates Early Modern England high compared standards, especially among infants. Infection disease ran rampant physicians realize need antiseptics sterile equipment. As result, communicable diseases often spread rapidly cities, particularly London. In addition, bubonic plague frequently ravaged England, two major outbreaks — 1592–1594 1603 — occurring Shakespeare’s lifetime. People understand plague generally perceived God’s punishment. (We know plague spread fleas could spread directly human human.) Without cure understanding transmitted disease, physicians could nothing stop thousands deaths resulted outbreak. These outbreaks direct effect Shakespeare’s career, government often closed theatres effort impede spread disease. London life In sixteenth century, London, though small compared modern cities, largest city Europe, population 200,000 inhabitants city surrounding suburbs. London crowded city without sewer system, facilitated epidemics plague. In addition, crime rates high city due inefficient law enforcement lack street lighting. Despite drawbacks, London cultural, political, social heart England. As home monarch England’s trade, London bustling metropolis. Not surprisingly, young Shakespeare moved London begin professional career. The theatre Most theatres actually located within city London. Rather, theatre owners built South bank Thames River (in Southwark) across city order avoid strict regulations applied within city’s walls. These restrictions stemmed mistrust public performances locations plague riotous behavior. Furthermore, theatre performances took place day, took laborers away jobs. Opposition theatres also came Puritans believed fostered immorality. Therefore, theatres moved city, areas near sites restricted activities, dog fighting, bear- bull-baiting, prostitution. Despite move, theatre free censorship regulation. In fact, branch government known Office Revels attempted ensure plays present politically socially sensitive material.

However, theatre companies developed costumes great care expense. In fact, playing company’s costumes valuable items. These extravagant costumes object much controversy aristocrats feared actors could use disguise social status streets London. Costumes also disguised player’s gender. All actors stage Shakespeare’s lifetime men. Young boys whose voices reached maturity played female parts. This practice doubt influenced Shakespeare’s contemporary playwrights’ thematic explorations cross-dressing. Though historians managed reconstruct appearance early modern theatre, recent construction Globe London, much information regarding plays performed era lost. Scholars Early Modern theatre turned scant external internal stage directions manuscripts effort find answers. Although hindrance modern critics scholars, lack detail Early Modern performances allowed modern directors actors great deal flexibility room creative. The printing press If printing press, many Early Modern plays may survived today. In Shakespeare’s time, printers produced books sheet — single large piece paper printer would fold order produce desired book size. For example, folio required folding sheet once, quarto four times, octavo eight, on. Sheets would printed one side time; thus, printers simultaneously print multiple nonconsecutive pages. In order estimate section text would page, printer would cast copy. After printer made estimates, compositors would set type upside down, letter letter. This process setting type produced textual errors, proofreader would catch. When proofreader found error, compositors would fix piece pieces type. Printers called corrections made printing began stop-press corrections literally stop press fix error. Because high cost paper, printers would still sell sheets printed made correction. Printers placed frames text bed printing press used imprint paper. They folded grouped sheets paper gatherings, pages ready sale. The buyer option getting new play bound. The printing process crucial preservation Shakespeare’s works, printing drama Early Modern England standardized practice. Many first editions Shakespeare’s plays appear quarto format and, recently, scholars regarded “corrupt.” In fact, scholars still debate close relationship exists appeared stage sixteenth seventeenth centuries appears printed page.

INTRODUCTION TO JULIUS CAESAR The seemingly straightforward simplicity Julius Caesar made perennial favorite almost 400 years. Despite simplicity, almost Roman nature, play rich dramatically thematically, every generation since Shakespeare’s time able identify political aspect play. The Victorians found stoic, sympathetic character Brutus found Caesar unforgivably weak tyrannical. As move twenty-first century, audiences readers, familiar leaders public imperfections, forgiving Caesar often suspicious Brutus’ moralistic posturing. The play also formed modern readers’ opinions views ancient Rome Romans. In article, “Shakespeare Elizabethan Romans,” published Shakespeare Survey #10 1957, critic T.J.B. Spencer wrote, “The part played Shakespeare creating notions ancient Romans forgotten . . . power Shakespeare’s imagination, power exercised several generations scarcely possible extricate ourselves.” The structure play follows closely pattern typical Elizabethan revenge play varies form Shakespeare’s history plays. 18 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Revenge plays, extremely popular theatre Shakespeare’s day, dealt retribution evil act. For example, murder always punished another murder often auspices original victim’s ghost. The person committed first murder, regardless personal honor motives, doomed beginning. Julius Caesar, play deals actual historical events, differs somewhat plays Shakespeare wrote English history. As Judah Stampfer points The Tragic Engagement: A Study Shakespeare’s Classical Tragedies, Shakespeare’s English history plays sought establish sort legitimacy end play. But Julius Caesar consists one illegitimate act another. Caesar overthrows Pompey damages republic. Brutus conspirators plot assassinate Caesar, mob rule tolerated, Antony instructs Octavius Machiavellian ethics play ends Octavius positioning authority, civil war imminent. The majority Shakespeare’s plays written blank verse Julius Caesar exception. Blank verse form poetry iambic pentameter. Each line ten syllables — five unstressed syllables alternating five stressed syllables. Occasionally, word usually pronounced one syllable accompanied grave accent. The accent indication word spoken two syllables. For example, word “moved,” usually one syllable, grave accent would pronounced “move-ed.” This allows line fall correctly rhythm iambic pentameter. During Renaissance, rekindling interest ancient Roman literature art. Thus, subject matter great interest Elizabethan audiences. Shakespeare wrote total four plays set ancient Rome. In addition Julius Caesar, Shakespeare’s Roman plays include Titus Andronicus, Antony Cleopatra, Coriolanus. Shakespeare especially interested character Julius Caesar mentions consistently plays, including Hamlet, Richard III, As You Like It, Henry IV, Parts 1 2, Henry VI, Parts 2 3. Date text Julius Caesar speculated Shakespeare’s twenty-first play, written end cycle history plays Hamlet. The play first performed, thus, thought written, 1599 may premier show newly rebuilt Globe Theatre. This date based journal Swiss traveler, Thomas Platter, visiting England September 18 October 20, 1599, attended two plays. In journal, translated Ernest Schanzer article, “Thomas Platter’s Observations Elizabethan Stage,” published Notes & Queries 1956, Platter described one plays saw many scholars believe writing Shakespeare’s play, Julius Caesar, performed The Globe: After lunch September 21st, two o’clock, I party crossed river, house thatched roof saw excellent performance tragedy first Emperor Julius Caesar fifteen characters; play, according custom elegant curious dance, two dressed men’s clothes, two women’s. Not published Shakespeare’s lifetime, Julius Caesar appeared first time seven years death First Folio 1623. The play appeared Folio The Tragedy Julius Caesar listed The Life Death Julius Caesar table contents. The text Julius Caesar, appears Folio, relatively errorfree reputation least corrupt text printed Folio. Because play rich Introduction Julius Caesar stage directions, thought compositors 1623 Folio likely working prompt book transcript document. A prompt book copy text used stage manager theatre. It marked character entrances exits, blocking, props, special effects offstage shouts, music, sounds thunder lightening. Shakespeare’s sources The majority Shakespeare’s information people events Julius Caesar taken work Greek historian, Plutarch (46?–120? A.D.). Sir Thomas North, working French version Plutarch’s works translated Jacques Amyot, published English language version Plutarch’s Lives Noble Grecians Romans 1579. It reprinted 1595 minimal changes 1603 addition life Octavius Caesar. Working North’s translations, Shakespeare used material Lives Julius Caesar, Marcus Antonius, Marcus Brutus. Because Plutarch interested moral characteristics subjects historical facts, Shakespeare found useful information stories would translate well onto theatrical stage. Plutarch’s telling lives Caesar, Antony, Brutus rich anecdotes characters well descriptions appearance personality traits. Being consummate playwright, however, Shakespeare able embellish stories adding compressed action, heightened drama, powerful speeches well internal external conflict. Many speeches play taken directly North’s translation rephrased fit blank verse. For example, Life Brutus, Plutarch records Brutus saying, “It rejoiceth heart, one friends hath failed need.” Shakespeare Brutus say, “My heart doth joy yet life / I found man 19 true me” (V.5.34–35). The Forum speeches, delivered Brutus Antony, results Shakespeare’s imagination proof enduring genius. Other sources Shakespeare may used Julius Caesar include biography Julius Caesar John Higgins A Mirror Magistrates Chaucer’s “The Monk’s Tale” The Canterbury Tales, Brutus Cassius seen spiteful assassins Caesar becomes honorable sacrifice. Shakespeare also influenced Dante’s Divine Comedy, Brutus Cassius seen lowest circle hell alongside Judas Iscariot. Performance history The first performance Julius Caesar occurred 1599. According Swiss traveler, Thomas Platter, play “very well acted” “elaborately costumed.” Although costuming Elizabethan theatres minimal, conjectured classical costuming production Julius Caesar including use breastplates plumed helmets. The play extremely popular original audience Leonard Digges wrote enthusiastic audiences play late 1620s. There proof play performed Whitehall 1611 1612, Saint James January 1636 Cock Pit year.

Not February 15, Feast T Lupercal, also day Julius Caesar triumphantly returns Spain defeating last Rome’s external adversaries. The crowd revelers happy day away usual tasks and, day considered high festival, plenty government-supplied food drink available all. The Lupercalian holiday, ancient rite purgation fertility, honored gods Lupercus Faunus well twin brothers Romulus Remus, legendary founders Rome. It seems appropriate Shakespeare chose particular feast setting return Julius Caesar Rome. Historically, Caesar returned Spain October 45 B.C., dramatically compressing events, Shakespeare draws comparison Romulus Remus, founders Rome, Caesar, founder new Roman order. By implication, religious festival, combined Caesar’s ceremonial entrance city, gives Caesar immediate godlike aura would possibly remind viewer Jesus’ triumphant entrance Jerusalem betrayal death cross. The merriment Roman people short-lived, however, scene quickly broken intrusion two Roman Tribunes, Marullus Flavius. The two men insult crowd admonish idle workday. They also question commoners walk “without sign profession.” This reference Elizabethan law required workers identify wearing work clothes carrying tools trade. Shakespeare often used Elizabethan references plays, regardless actual timeframe story taking place, way making work accessible audience. Another example Shakespeare using Elizabethan references scene 30 Act I, Scene 1 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Although majority people Rome happy leader, not. This small-scale conflict reflected next scene full-blown conspiracy Caesar begins take shape. Shakespeare also uses first scene play establish “the mob” character life set characteristics, moved change mind issue well-chosen words. A relief Romulus Remus, 1st century, A.D. Mark Smith/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd. reference towers chimney tops. There towers chimneys ancient Rome, anachronisms, chronologically misplaced events, words details, bring play alignment experiences audience play written. Finally, scene introduces one many images enhances play well one play’s recurring themes. The word “blood,” implying dual meaning “life-nourishing” “death-inducing,” used consistently throughout play. Here, Caesar triumphed Pompey’s blood, soon time Caesar’s body, lying bloody base Pompey’s statue, triumphed Pompey. This image illustrates theme Julius Caesar, blood begets blood. Shakespeare wrote majority plays blank verse, often changed verse prose indicate social status character. In scene, tribunes speak verse commoners use prose. In delightful bit wordplay, Carpenter Cobbler frustrate Tribunes evasive puns bawdy innuendoes. Puns, play words spelled sound different meanings, often called lowest form humor, Elizabethan audiences delighted them. In general, crowd content harmony abundance lives concerned parties politics. Infuriated mob’s indifference, Marullus questions crowd’s memories motivations. How Caesar’s returning defeat another Roman victory? Marullus also underscores fickleness people reminding long ago stood place celebrating return Pompey celebrate return man who, “comes triumph Pompey’s blood.” The Tribunes scold onlookers suggest gods send plague type ingratitude chastised crowd silently guiltily disperses. The conflict factions commoner official serves two dramatic functions. First, Shakespeare puts central conflict play place. The birth Julius Caesar.

CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act I, Scene 2 41 COMMENTARY disparity public image private man central Julius Caesar, introT duction Caesar certainly underscores Shakespeare’s ability understand portray complex often dual nature human beings. Despite debate raged years actual “hero” Julius Caesar, clear-cut protagonist ever emerges play. The simplistic beauty drama lies fact that, like life stage, politicians public figures, matter populace chooses see them, mere mortals ailments torments, delusions misjudgments common person. A great flourish trumpets signals arrival Caesar entourage. A large crowd people includes friends foes accompanies him. Julius Caesar depicted deity chariot. Mary Evans Picture Library Although speak lines never referred to, stage directions indicate Marullus Flavius, chastising tribunes previous scene, part crowd, possibly prisoners already arrested desecrating Caesar’s statues. The two men chains would serve potent visual image Caesar’s power control attempts undermine authority. Also crowd Caesar’s right-hand man, Marc Antony, men become prevailing forces conspiracy Caesar. Marc Antony, also known Marcus Antonius, related Julius Caesar mother’s side. He staunch supporter Caesar conflicts Pompey served Caesar’s army Gaul. In Scene 2, Antony dressed “for course.” As indicated Scene 1, Feast 42 Act I, Scene 2 Lupercal. During holiday, priests Lupercus, dressed loincloths made goatskin, sacrificed goats dog smeared sacrificial blood. They ran city carrying goatskin thong, called februa. Women placed way priests could strike februa, thus assuring women fertility easy childbirth. In short exchange, Shakespeare makes apparent Antony’s exalted position priest Luperci loyal dedicated follower Caesar. When asked touch Calpurnia thong, Antony’s reply, “When Caesar says ‘Do this,’ performed,” explicitly defines depth allegiance leader Rome. Caesar’s first words directed wife, Calpurnia. She Caesar’s third wife daughter friend Pompey’s, indicating marriage likely politically motivated. Indeed, young, healthy bride able produce heir Caesar surely desires guarantee continuation reign leader Rome. Caesar’s rather brazen public acknowledgment Calpurnia’s sterility gives several clues Caesar’s character motivations. First, must maintain public image degrading Calpurnia. In insensitive rather humiliating manner, Caesar seems place blame lack children wife. However, “sterile curse” could Caesar’s aging impotence prevents Calpurnia becoming pregnant. According Plutarch, Shakespeare’s main source much play, “The chiefest cause made [Caesar] mortally hated covetous desire called king.” Caesar’s obvious desire produce male heir may indicate Caesar indeed thinking along lines. Just Caesar makes obvious believes superstition attached Lupercal cure Calpurnia supposed sterility, procession interrupted warnings soothsayer, man sees future. Both Romans Caesar’s time Elizabethans saw play enacted stage The Globe superstitious would appreciated import prophecies, dreams, omens, anticipated dire results CliffsComplete Julius Caesar signs ignored. Here, Caesar warned “Beware Ides March,” despite fact proven superstitious man pertains others, chooses ignore warning dismisses soothsayer nothing dreamer. Ironically, Cassius, man repeats soothsayer’s warning Caesar, man help make prophecy come true. Caesar’s brief exchange soothsayer provides insights Caesar’s character. He man tempt fates ignoring messages passed soothsayer. In essence, Caesar seems put par gods, control destiny opposed controlled it. This arrogance would red flag Elizabethan audiences Caesar setting mighty fall grace. Also, Caesar’s use third person referring suggests Caesar begun believe press. The references combined disregard prophecy point fact Caesar actively participating deification. Followed crowd, Caesar leaves stage watch race. Two men, Brutus Cassius, lag behind and, left alone stage, begin dialogue change course history. Marcus Junius Brutus, born 85 B.C., nephew Cato, one Caesar’s unyielding adversaries. As Cato’s nephew, Brutus considered enemy Caesar. He fought Pompey Greece taken prisoner Pompey defeated. In effort heal wounds civil war, Caesar pardoned set free prisoners war, including Brutus. Shortly thereafter, Brutus became lieutenant Caesar’s army continued serve loyally. Although Shakespeare makes direct mention play, common knowledge Elizabethans Brutus’ mother, Servilia, affair Julius Caesar. Because Brutus born time relationship, speculated Brutus might actually Caesar’s illegitimate son. Brutus subscribed philosophy known Stoicism, maintains universe completely rational guided fate. Therefore, one must learn CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act I, Scene 2 accept whatever happens strong tranquil mind. Virtue, attainment valor, moral excellence, righteousness, key happy life becomes ultimate goal Stoic; vice evil leads unhappiness. Stoicism encourages man centered intellect suppressing feelings. Brutus’ attempt maintain emotionless moral superiority, based Stoic philosophy, becomes double-edged sword ultimately leads — Rome — destruction. Caius Cassius Longinus also ally Pompey, saw Pompey’s defeat imminent, changed allegiance and, pardoned Caesar, became soldier Caesar’s army. Cassius, married Brutus’ sister Junia, Brutus’s brother-inlaw. Unlike Stoic Brutus, Cassius Epicurean. The philosophy Epicureanism promoted notion freedom physical pain mental trouble goal happy life. Again, virtue, courage, justice considered attributes needed attain wisdom, unlike intellectual center stoicism, Epicurians felt knowledge derived senses. Brutus’ cold unwavering intellect offers direct contrast fiery, passionate nature Cassius. Thus, Brutus lived head, Cassius lived heart. Just Brutus’ inability balance head heart lead downfall, Cassius’ inability balance heart head also lead ruin. Much manipulation occurs Julius Caesar achieved use flattery. In scene, Cassius plies Brutus praise compliments. He speaks Brutus’ worthiness high respect 43 held throughout Rome offers mirror reflect Brutus’ honorable qualities see. The mirror reflection moral nature man common literary device Renaissance literature, Shakespeare uses device hold mirror moral nature man many occasions throughout plays. More often not, however, reflected discord inherent man’s sinful nature. For example, Julius Caesar, Brutus admits war himself. What internal war consists revealed Scene 2 first flourishes shouts heard crowd offstage. Brutus admits fears people chosen Caesar king but, breath, swears loves man. By end speech, however, becomes apparent that, determinedly Stoic Brutus, love never conquer come need maintain honor. At admission fears, Cassius leaps opportunity involve Brutus conspiracy Caesar. Taking advantage Brutus’ commitment Caesar passing Rubicon. Ronald Sheridan/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd. 44 Act I, Scene 2 honor virtue, Cassius plays upon words draw Brutus deeply conspiracy. By pointing Caesar’s weaknesses physical imperfections, Cassius seeks emphasize Caesar better Brutus is. Cassius continues build argument Caesar appealing Brutus’ sense patriotism free Rome persists flattering Brutus reference valiant ancestor, noted overthrown King Tarquin creating Roman Republic. Cassius’ words work magic Brutus agrees similar thoughts would willing discuss issue safer convenient time. In scene, Shakespeare foreshadows Caesar’s death uses irony underscore become part dramatic unity play. In speaking power inherent Caesar’s name, Cassius says, “Conjure ‘em: / ‘Brutus’ start spirit soon ‘Caesar’. . . “ indeed irony Brutus, killing Caesar, release spirit. By conjuring Caesar’s spirit unleashed upon world, Brutus reality given name “Caesar” power death Caesar might life. Caesar’s spirit, cannot killed, dominate second half play. Readers feel play called Marcus Brutus underestimate historical significance Caesar’s continuing power even death. In Scene 2, Shakespeare first introduces image fire infuses play point on. Fire, which, like blood, either destructive purifying force, represents passion ability inflame enkindle. In lines 176–177, Brutus personifies flint Cassius strikes effort spark sort flame fire conspiracy Caesar. When Caesar reenters stage, subdued nature crowd, red face Caesar, pale looks Calpurnia signal something significance transpired offstage Brutus Cassius conversed onstage. Cassius pulls Casca aside inquire events taken place Caesar notices men speaking together whispers. From insights Cassius’ character, evident Caesar “great observer” “look deeds men,” pride vanity allow admit real danger man like Cassius could pose. CliffsComplete Julius Caesar In play, thought known Caesar secondhand information passed enemies. Through eyes, portrait drawn vain arrogant man weak unyielding. Historically, Julius Caesar recorded intelligent, witty, charming man. An excellent orator brilliant writer, Caesar brought much needed reforms Roman Senate, instituted first public library, improved system taxation, rebuilt cities, sought laws passed would strengthen moral fabric society. Shakespeare’s Caesar reflects little redeeming qualities remains human ambiguous characters play. Indeed, Shakespeare seems deliberately balance Caesar’s posturing almost immediate confessions weakness. For example, lines 212–213, Caesar proclaims “for always I Caesar,” immediately followed admission partially deaf. Caesar’s seizures, recorded Plutarch, deafness, invented Shakespeare, serve dramatic function well indicators Caesar’s character. Caesar’s infirmities become symbolic of, metaphor for, diseases running rampant Rome. In Shakespeare’s time, Elizabethans aware existence body politic, way defining state human terms. The leader head body politic; people represent limbs. Just Caesar’s illnesses weaken constitution, state’s illnesses, bipartisanism civil disorder, weaken body politic. Casca reveals Brutus Cassius events took place stage caused show concern Caesar followers. According cynical Casca, speaking plain straightforward prose, Antony offered crown laurel leaves Caesar, who, show humility, refused it. The crowd cheered Caesar’s refusal crown choice continue refuse laurel wreath three separate occasions. In Casca’s view, Caesar desperately wanted accept crown, refusal act adoring crowd. Obviously, red face proof, Caesar angered crowd’s reaction suffered epileptic fit. The common people’s love Caesar grows fever pitch. There need among masses “Caesar,” time being, happy content one. CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act I, Scene 2 45 Casca expresses concern events transpired delivers news Marullus Flavius put death. Casca agrees meet Cassius later time.

Fire drops skies, bodies spontaneously combust, lions roam capitol, ghostly women walk streets, night owl seen shrieking daylight. Casca enters sword drawn fright apparent encounters Cicero. Second Caesar, Marcus Tullius Cicero, born 106 B.C., important man Rome. Highly educated Greece, Cicero became Rome’s prominent lawyer orator. Despite excellent reputation acclaimed achievements, Cicero feared Julius Caesar made things difficult Cicero Rome driven Italy 59 B.C. Cicero joined forces Pompey, became clear Pompey going defeated, Cicero pleaded mercy Caesar, habit, Caesar pardoned Cicero. Cicero returned Rome Senate, remained publicly neutral Caesar’s reforms government. Unlike modern theatres, computerized special effects state art sound systems, Elizabethan theatre relied mainly words paint scenery suggest sounds thunder lightning. Elizabethan stagehands without certain amount clever inventiveness, however, sound lighting effects could created. For example, beating drums rolling large round bullets backstage often produced sound thunder. The effect lightning could contrived blowing rosin candle flame create bright flash fire. Shakespeare, like many writers, uses storms create mood darkness foreboding, takes image one step further. The turmoil heavens directly representative turmoil present state minds men. The raging storm, coupled eerie sights Casca describes, signs disharmony heaven earth. Signs omens, nature, meant interpreted misinterpretation manipulation signs omens become important thematic issues Julius Caesar. The ambiguities present people events play underscored Cicero points Casca, “men may construe things fashion / Clean purpose things themselves.” Casca, dismayed storm, suggests either civil strife heaven gods angry deeds men.

In face irate heavens, Casca loses use sarcastic prose begins speak blank verse. The imagery storm Casca describes lines 3–11 infused metaphorical references Caesar. He speaks earth “shakes like thing infirm” epileptic Caesar shook refuse crown. Casca speaks “ambitious ocean” “swell rage foam.” The picture draws reminiscent ambitious tyrant, whose ego swelled power, one rages getting way ends foaming mouth epileptic fit. After Cassius admonishes Casca particular Rome general weak “womanish,” Casca makes announcement Senate plans make Caesar king assembly following day. Historically, Caesar called senate emergency session set meet March 15. Caesar might instigated session Senate approve declaration war Parthenians. However, historians speculate made King Provinces anticipation that, outlying cities Italy accepted Caesar King, city Rome would quickly follow. If conspirators intend stop Caesar crowned, must tomorrow Senate opportunity convene. Cassius disgusted interprets apathy Roman people, sees mere sheep would blindly follow leader whatever dangers might lead them. Metaphorically, Cassius sees commoners trash rubbish. Recalling image fire, become “base matter” fuel “illuminate” inflame ego “vile” Caesar. 52 Act I, Scene 3 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Between Cassius’ interpretation storm gods raging Caesar’s tyranny fact Caesar may crowned king following day, Casca persuaded join forces Cassius.

[Exeunt.] 330 335 68 Act II, Scene 1 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar COMMENTARY S cholars speculate Hamlet written immediately Shakespeare finished Julius Caesar. If case, would seem quite likely soulsearching Brutus became prototype character Hamlet. Just Hamlet endlessly questions analyzes actions, Brutus, Act II, Scene 1, contemplates ramifications joining conspiracy Julius Caesar. Scene 1 takes place Brutus’ garden, usually place quiet tranquility man may commune nature. Tonight, however, storm raged Rome Brutus’ private domain is, like rest nature, terrible turmoil. As previous scene, unnatural disharmony universe symbolic dissonance state representative discord Brutus’ soul. There chaos cosmos even time joint: “I cannot progress stars / Give guess near day.” Brutus unable determine time day; also trouble remembering day month is. In 1623 Folio version play, line 40 reads, “Is tomorrow first March?” Many editors change line read “the Ides March” possible Shakespeare audience would understood Brutus’ confusion time. On one level, Brutus’ inability determine time date would suggest equally unable understand times living. The people Rome happy content leader Brutus, like Cassius previous scene, refuse see that. His confusion time could also direct reference major political issue occurring England throughout Europe time Julius Caesar written. Julius Caesar credited creating Julian calendar Plutarch suggests many Caesar’s detractors cited new calendar evidence him. They claimed implementation calendar proof tyrannical tendencies manipulation time interference true course nature. By year 1582, Julian calendar drifted ten days phase Pope Gregory decreed reform existing calendar. The Catholic followers Pope adopted new calen- dar whereas Protestants rejected it. The issue calendar reform became intense political struggle Europe. By 1598, year Shakespeare thought written Julius Caesar, five weeks separating celebrations Catholic Easter Protestant Easter. Many English Protestants, like Romans them, felt forced Queen Elizabeth maintain Julian calendar tyrannical interference true course nature. Brutus’ envy servant Lucius’ ability sleep soundly suggests mind recently troubled worry Caesar’s power prevents finding rest. In referring lean hungry Cassius previous act, Caesar intimates men cannot sleep night dangerous sleepless Brutus indeed become danger Julius Caesar. In nocturnal ruminations, Brutus begun convince Caesar must die. Brutus’ interior debate ensuing verdict Caesar must assassinated illustrates major flaws Brutus’ character. He sees noble man strong sense morality works hard maintain image public. In soliloquy, however, audience sees man convince murder appropriate answer based solely conjecture. Brutus merely speculates Caesar may become powerful anticipation power may do, makes decision support actions conspiracy. History consistently demonstrates power corrupt, populace decided eliminate politicians based possibility may become power-hungry, would leaders left. Brutus’ decision join plot murder Caesar based fallacious logic shows man considers knowledge human nature great capable seeing future. By assuming play god, prevent he, infinite wisdom, sees harmful Rome. In light, Brutus different Caesar? Caesar, based reforms Italy, judged harshly wanting Rome conform worldview Brutus behaves like man kill. In so, forces world conform personal vision it. Brutus concerned sense self CliffsComplete Julius Caesar recognize irrational logic inability reason; fault undermine conspiracy create havoc Rome professes love dearly. In addition Brutus’ skewed logic, susceptible vanity inordinate pride also highlighted scene. Lucius, finding one forged letters thrown Brutus’ window, brings note Brutus fails recognize forgery. Instead, views note public affirmation recent decision eliminate Caesar. His pride ancestor man vanquished Tarquin King spurs fill blanks forged note version people want. He vanquish King take place among great heroes Rome. Brutus completely aware hideous quality conspiracy personifies monster lines 78–85. He may delude searching soul motives killing Caesar, knows without doubt act evil thing hidden away. Brutus nothing consummate politician cognizant fact often necessary politics mask monster “smiles affability.” Shakespeare’s reference Erebus passage packed meaning interesting segue next section text. According Greek mythology, Erebus, dark underground passage Hell, born Chaos. Chaos primordial void existed order created universe things, including gods, proceeded. Immediately following reference, Cassius conspirators emerge dark, chaotic night take places dark chaotic history Rome follow death Caesar. Cassius, always man focused mission, greets Brutus words flattery two men move one side, conversing whispers conspirators take center stage. In portion scene, Shakespeare depicts inability men tell time day. Not writer draw attention incompetence men judge times live also shows unorganized contradictory group cannot agree sun rises, much less issues vast political importance. Act II, Scene 1 69 Brutus, newest official member conspiracy, begins association group bumbling confused men blunders own. Cassius suggests conspirators swear oath, Brutus quickly vetoes. Although Brutus knows murder dishonorable act, must find way “fashion” something noble virtuous swear oath, would give conspiracy appearance secrecy exclusivity. An oath would also give way possibilities lies betrayals oath, “appearance,” important politician, vital Brutus’ personal sense honor give endeavor look honesty lofty ideals. The next issue broached possible addition Cicero list conspirators. As revealed earlier, Cicero excellent coercive speaker. He knew law and, seen contrast Casca storm scene, Cicero calm collected pressure. He would invaluable addition conspiracy again, Brutus says no. This time cites excuse Cicero “will never follow anything / That men begin.” Brutus intimidated Cicero’s tendency leader rather follower. If Cicero took lead enterprise, would noted history man freed Rome tyrant king? Cassius, effort keep Brutus content part conspiracy, concedes again. Decius asks anyone Caesar “be touched.” Cassius quickly responds would benefit plans “Antony Caesar fall together.” Where Brutus political idealist, Cassius political realist. Cassius understands workings human nature much better judge character Brutus. He knows Antony loyal friend Caesar also fine soldier would solid position mount attack conspiracy. Brutus, hand, sees Antony’s weaknesses: “he given / To sports, wildness, much company.” Shakespeare, using image body politic, Brutus compare Antony merely limb body wither die head, Caesar, severed. In underestimating Antony’s strengths, Brutus continues course doom conspiracy failure. Brutus’ reticence kill Antony along Caesar first glance noble one, closer look 70 Act II, Scene 1 motives reveals clever politician attempting little spin-doctoring. Just Caesar attempted beginning play make Feast Lupercal, religious ceremony, political one, Brutus desires make political act something religious. If Brutus succeed making act cold-blooded murder done advance personal ambitions small group men something perceived sacred, achieved two things. Personally, able relieve conscience rationalizing immoral act something moral. In addition, act appears religious sacrifice, “common eyes” people Rome believe conspirators done “necessary, envious.” Brutus, like every good politician, concerned actions interpreted general populace seeks manipulate situations win approval. CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Up point play, public Brutus seen. With entrance wife, Portia, reader opportunity witness private Brutus. He different man within confines home. He gentle servant, Lucius, seems genuinely worried Portia enters scene, expressing concern exposing “raw cold morning.” Portia paints portrait husband recently become illustrates audience private Brutus becoming involved plot Caesar. Brutus shows evidence man capacity feel deeply people situations unfortunately chooses deny feelings public effort maintain honorable stoic image. As final plans drawn Caesar’s assassination, clock strikes three. In majority editions Julius Caesar, striking clock often identified anachronism. There mechanical clocks Rome Julius Caesar, but, opposed mistake writer, striking clock could serve another reminder time times living sync. Also, fact Brutus asks conspirators “Count clock” may Shakespeare’s way underscoring number three number identified betrayal. The majority Elizabethans watching play would perhaps associate number three number times Peter betrayed Jesus also time, according Bible, Jesus died upon cross. Portia Brutus’ first cousin well second wife. At time play takes place, married two years. She daughter Marcus Porcuis Cato “Cato Younger,” leader Pompey’s army fought Caesar Africa. Known steadfast virtue adherence principles, Cato committed suicide rather surrender Caesar’s army. Portia strong woman, proud lineage, afraid confront husband take stand equality marriage. She confronts Brutus, demanding know troubled, allow cover activities evasive stories ill health. Appealing Brutus’ sense honor, questions dishonoring sharing secrets her. Brutus, one sincere heartfelt responses, replies “true honourable wife, / As dear ruddy drops / That visit sad heart.” The men prepare leave Cassius expresses concern that, Caesar recently become superstitious, might choose go Capitol. Decius assures others able convince Caesar go Capitol matter mood may volunteers escort Capitol himself. Cassius insists everyone meet Caesar accompany Capitol. The plot set, hour agreed upon Brutus bids farewell conspirators admonishment conceal purpose and, like actors, put mask normalcy. Portia reminds Brutus heritage association hopes convince Brutus stronger majority wives. To prove fearlessness, constancy, equality, shows Brutus wound made thigh. According Plutarch, Portia gashed razor. The gash became infected quite ill, running high fever. It might possibly fever Brutus refers early part scene comments wife’s weak health. The ability suffer silently highly prized Roman virtue and, wounding herself, Portia seeks prove constant worthy Brutus’ trust. CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Her husband convinced Portia’s trustworthiness promises tell everything soon possible. The image illness theme disease runs continuously Julius Caesar. Caesar’s deafness, epilepsy, possible inability produce children revealed early Act I. Before Cassius conspirators enter scene Act II, Brutus comments disease occurs conception idea action completes it. He speaks “genius” soul man war body “mortal instruments.” As soul spiritual nature man battles mortal base desires, state humanity body politic suffers becomes ill. Shakespeare often compares illness discord mankind dissonance rampant universe. The scene Brutus Portia incorporates illness real speculative, entrance Caius Ligarius blatant images sickness man body politic. Due illness, Ligarius, senator originally supported Pompey had, like conspirators, pardoned Caesar, comes late meeting. He tells Brutus illness cured Brutus involved “exploit worthy name honor.” According Brutus, honorable exploit is, “A piece work make sick men whole.” Caius replies, “But whole must make sick?” Disease running Act II, Scene 1 71 rampant individuals Rome. Caesar, head Rome, suffering overly ambitious desires power. His illness infected rest body, people Rome. Brutus cannot sleep night wife fears ill. Portia running high fever wound inflicted herself. Ligarius’ health affects conspiracy. There choice find cure illness kills entire body. Unfortunately, Brutus Cassius effect cure. Rather, choose cut head body (Caesar) effort heal body whole, body cannot live without head, Rome cured ills way either. The body, either human politic, must head. Without it, body dies. Brutus Cassius made plans cut disease diagnosed fatal Rome, scheme seems stop there. No discussion ensued concerning happen Caesar dead. Who rule Rome? Will new regime govern people new ways? The conspirators lethally shortsighted lack plan action spells disaster cause, whatever may be. Caius Ligarius, final lines scene, calls Brutus “Soul Rome.” If Brutus indeed shining example conscience spiritual nature Rome, wonder chaos disorder tormenting capitol Italy. 72 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act II, Scene 2 Act II, Scene 2 Caesar’s wife, Calpurnia, concerned violent storm odd sightings reported throughout Rome.

Just private side Brutus exposed last scene, Shakespeare shows us private side Caesar. By showing consecutive scenes, men homes, conversations wives, Shakespeare highlights parallel lives two men. Both men sleepless nights; wives concerned well being; and, play progresses, Brutus become like man seeks destroy. The foreshadowing Caesar’s imminent death begins early scene Caesar comments dreams tormented wife, Calpurnia, night. Immediately following revelations Calpurnia cried sleep, “They murder Caesar,” Caesar instructs servant priests sacrifice animal purpose determining future. Obviously, Caesar concerned possible portents Calpurnia’s dream bears Cassius’ claim become quite superstitious lately. Alone, private Caesar fearful man concerned signs point ominous future. The Capitoline Forum. Gianni Tortoli/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd. Upon Calpurnia’s entrance, Caesar replaces public mask begins speaking third person. Even wife privacy chambers, Caesar unwilling cast god-like demeanor. If humble Caesar time, gone now, place man promoting glorification. Calpurnia relates heard strange events previous night. She speaks lions giving birth streets graves opened “yielded dead.” She tells blood dripping upon capitol comets blazing heavens Caesar discounts every single omen. (The sighting comet always held connotation death monarch.) In July (the month Caesar’s birth) 44 B.C., four months Caesar’s death, comet, bright could seen day, observed seven days skies Rome. Octavius Caesar used phenomena encourage myth Caesar’s deification. When servant appears, informs Caesar priests insist Caesar stay home today heart found morning’s sacrifice, still Caesar refuses swayed. Caesar purposely tempting Fates denying every sign sent prevent death. He seems recognize hand Fate plays lives ordinary men pompously ignores reference himself: “these predictions / Are world general Caesar.” Calpurnia, frightened frustrated Caesar’s refusal acknowledge signs sent gods, accuses allowing wisdom destroyed conceit. The moment Caesar acquiesces Calpurnia agrees stay home, 78 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act II, Scene 2 Decius makes entrance. His plan (to make sure Caesar goes capitol) immediate danger thwarted. Decius wants know Caesar planning go Capitol, Caesar relates Calpurnia’s dream him. Decius, promised, master manipulation, begins work sorcery Caesar appealing vanity. He tells Caesar “This dream amiss interpreted,” and, words, Decius articulates one major themes present Julius Caesar, manipulation fact fallacy achieve one’s end. Julius Caesar Conspirators. So much play Mary Evans Picture Library misinterpreted many, distortions often result characters’ ego-driven desire proven right. The conspirators misconstrue feelings common people towards Caesar. Casca, Cassius, Caesar confuse signs omens storm. Brutus continually misinterprets people situations, Cassius die misinterprets message end play. In particular instance, Decius, appealing Caesar’s vanity, reinterprets Calpurnia’s dream something ominous something fortuitous. Instead interpreting Caesar’s blood pouring statue sign impending death, Decius declares blood sign Caesar provides nourishment heal Rome people. In clever display flattery, Decius imposes religious connotations dream, suggesting people Rome, rather rejoicing Caesar’s spilt blood, actually searching “tinctures, stains, relics, cognizance.” The reference religious icons places Caesar shadow sainthood, referring belief handkerchiefs dipped blood martyrs healing properties. Just Caesar’s death foreshadowed Calpurnia’s dream, Decius foreshadows Caesar’s eventual martyrdom rise virtual sainthood ironic interpretation dream’s symbolism. Not wanting risk chance Caesar may still refuse go Capitol, Decius reminds Senate planning give crown day. He also warns Caesar Senators might possibly ridicule stays home wife bad dream. Caesar swayed and, agrees leave Capitol, conspirators enter scene. Interestingly, Cassius conspicuously missing list conspirators named stage directions. Considering insistence previous scene “we us fetch him,” seems strange Cassius would among co-conspirators crucial moment. Perhaps Cassius CliffsComplete Julius Caesar aware Caesar trust makes decision stay away order arouse Caesar’s suspicion. After close examination play, textual scholars Fredson Bowers suggest parts Cassius Ligarius played actor. In scenes Cassius appears, Ligarius stage, Ligarius seen, Cassius missing.

Lend hand [Exeunt CAESAR’S body.] 290 295 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act III, Scene 1 99 COMMENTARY dramatic tension grows Caesar’s inevitable march toward death progresses. He enters T stage followed conspirators intercepted Soothsayer Artemidorus. In display seemingly designed impress public, Caesar haughtily dismisses Soothsayer and, show false modesty, refuses read Artemidorus’ note later: “What touches us ourself shall last served.” By refusing acknowledge omens present previous evening’s storm, missing heart auguers sacrifice, Calpurnia’s dream, soothsayer’s warning, Artemidorus’ note, becomes obvious Caesar’s arrogance triumphed wisdom. Any sympathy reader might felt plight almost non-existent. Caesar’s earlier perception Cassius great observer sees deeds men especially significant scene. With heightened sense apprehension brought fear caught, Cassius notices Artemidorus trying pass scroll Caesar and, along Publius, urges move Capitol. He approached Popilius expresses wish “your enterprise to-day may thrive.” Cassius feigns ignorance pretends know Popilius speaking about, fear grows watches Popilius move toward Caesar’s side. With real possibility disclosure, Cassius swears Brutus plot discovered kill rather arrested treason. Suicide, predominately Christian, Elizabethan audience, would take much different connotation ancient Rome. To Shakespeare’s audience, indeed many readers even today, suicide considered mortal sin; act God nature. In Elizabethan England, also act government. A suspected victim suicide would allowed receive final sacraments buried sacred ground. Often, victims suicide buried center crossroads, spirits, thought unable go heaven, would wander world. Many Elizabethans believed body suicide victim buried crossroads, ghost victim would know direction follow. All money property belonging suicide victims would confiscated state, leaving surviving family humiliated destitute. From Roman perspective, however, suicide considered act heroism done effort avoid living life conflicted moral ethical values held esteem person committing act. For Cassius, living tyranny Caesar unthinkable. Thus, death would become alternative. For many members Shakespeare’s original audience, Cassius’ desire die rather arrested treason emotion could identify with. The severed heads men women accused treason Crown, often not, adorned spikes along castle walls London. Shakespeare’s plays written specifically performance, stage directions often indicated within text rather added script. Lines 25–26 represent example known implied stage direction. Cassius points Brutus Trebonius set motion next stage plot Caesar: “Trebonius knows time, look you, Brutus, / He draws Mark Antony way.” This would indicate actor must engage Mark Antony way would “draw” stage. With Mark Antony way, Decius comes forward put last moves conspiracy place. Metellus Cimber approach Caesar first ask pardon banished brother. Each conspirator turn join Cimber Caesar surrounded Casca assigned job first stab Caesar. Caesar takes place prepares address business day. As planned, Metellus Cimber approaches Caesar asks reinstatement brother Roman Citizen. Caesar’s arrogance reaches astounding proportions refuses Cimber’s plea based distaste flattery power remain constant. Ironically, Caesar’s tendency swayed flattery witnessed preceding scene constancy ambiguous best. For example, spent much previous scene vacillating staying home going capitol faltering one interpretation Calpurnia’s dream other. Shakespeare master showing sides issue character, possible interpret Caesar’s recent actions ways. The qualities 100 Act III, Scene 1 comprise great leader major theme Julius Caesar, issue often hotly debated. Even though Caesar’s arrogance seems motivating factor much does, also possible look choices another manner. With regards Artemidorus’ letter example, Caesar refuses look later, matter within letter personal Caesar. Possibly, choice illustrates Caesar’s propensity put issues people concerns. Constancy also important quality effective leader. It unjust one set rules friends another set everyone else. In “Northern Star” speech, Caesar maintaining firm position based laws Rome judgment passed Metellus Cimber’s brother ruling factions government. Mercy compassion must figure laws land leader’s responsibility maintain laws set without displaying favoritism? Caesar’s choices argued either arrogant admirable growing sense deification destroys man. By comparing Olympus, mountain Greece presumed home gods, Caesar publicly declaring godlike presence within himself. However, instead showing god-like mercy compassion pardoning Cimber’s brother, Caesar chooses exhibit human quality fundamental stubbornness. By time Julius Caesar assassinated Senate Brutus companions. Mary Evans Picture Library CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Casca raises hand Caesar, almost relief reader bring end Caesar’s egotistical hubris. Despite Brutus’ earlier instructions Caesar’s death clean possible, conspirator takes turn Caesar. Having endured twenty-two stab wounds, still standing Caesar, lacerations pouring forth blood, becomes fulfillment Calpurnia’s dream. It twenty-third wound, however, inflicted Brutus, man loved perhaps fathered, causes Caesar’s life force vanish, falls dead floor. The sympathy audience immediately swings back Caesar pathos last words — “Et tu, Brute? — Then fall Caesar” — echoes stunned silent Senate. Cinna breaks eerie silence cries “Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny dead!” Chaos ensues one senator run streets proclaiming news Caesar’s assassination. In brilliant stroke middle carnage adds decidedly compassionate edge Brutus Cassius, Shakespeare leaves one aging senator alone stage conspirators. Brutus assures frightened old man harmed Cassius worries Publius might hurt madness suggests leave right away. According Plutarch, member conspiracy, order equally involved murder, agreed stab Caesar least once. With twentythree stab wounds, Caesar’s body resembled hacked carcass sacrificial “dish gods” Brutus aspired to.

Caesar’s blood flows across stage also covers arms hands well weapons murderers. As almost every image play, one interpreted numerous ways. If murder Caesar barbaric deed done personal agendas greedy, jealous men, blood hands conspirators sign guilt. If, however, murder sacrificial purging sickness runs body politic Rome, blood becomes symbol catharsis purification. Throughout play, Brutus’ poor political judgment laid foundation failure conspiracy. In scene, reader also made privy Brutus’ naivete. Not Brutus convince Caesar’s murder sacrifice, making heroes conspirators, justifies act beneficial, rationalizing believing actually saved Caesar terrible fate spend many years fearing death. Act III, Scene 1 101 In highly charged elation moments following Caesar’s death, Shakespeare uses dramatic construct come known metadrama metatheatre. Throughout many plays, Shakespeare makes reference belief “All world’s stage, / And men women merely players” frequently uses convention play-within-the-play works A Midsummer’s Night Dream Hamlet. Metadrama much like picture mirror must reflect infinity. Which real image mere reflection? The reader jolted suspension disbelief different dimension theatricality, one highlights capricious illusory nature theatre. Brutus Cassius, casting leading players “lofty scene,” believe heroes and, real sense, hiding behind metaphorical mask actors, absolve horrendous deed. Cassius’ question, “How many ages hence / Shall lofty scene acted / In states unborn accents yet unknown!” prophetic many ways. Shakespeare’s play performed consistently almost 400 years since death languages unheard countries undiscovered time play written. To modern readers takes even deeper meaning, history continued repeat assassinations great leaders Ghandi, John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr. As long men power, men kill gain it. As conspirators preparing leave Capitol explain deeds masses, servant sent Mark Antony detains them. Up point 102 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act III, Scene 1 play, Antony minor character, one raised contempt concern. Only Cassius thought possible threat. The frivolous Mark Antony seen earlier scenes play transforms shrewd, clever, astute politician. Antony aware enough know anyone Caesar die, him. So Antony sends servant conspirators well-prepared speech make sure safe approach. The message, related servant, foreshadows Antony’s ability manipulate people situations words. The first line message appeals Brutus’ vanity, calling him, “noble, wise, valiant, honest.” Cassius voices misgivings Brutus overrules allows Antony enter Capitol explanation Caesar’s murder. Antony shocked dismayed see ravaged body Caesar, knows must bide time make friends conspirators avenge Caesar’s death. Antony continues running metaphor disease blood asks, “Who else must let blood, else rank.” If body politic swollen disease, blood Antony may required purge state, restoring health. Brutus assures conspirators desire harm way. Cassius, usual political acuity, cuts Brutus’ offer love reverence offer Antony practical desirable proposal: share power perks new government. Antony answer Cassius’ offers proceeds, show friendship respect, shake bloody hand conspirators. With Caesar’s blood hands, Antony evokes Caesar’s spirit first time. Caesar’s spirit Caesar dead. Mary Evans Picture Library pervade remainder play, and, though body dead, influence lives on. Again, Cassius interrupts Antony insists upon knowing whether Antony counted friend conspiracy. Antony gives evasive answer quickly changes subject, asking permission speak funeral Caesar. Brutus agrees immediately, Cassius, noticed Antony’s evasive answers questioned loyalty conspiracy, takes Brutus aside cautions make mistake allowing Antony speak funeral. Brutus refuses listen Cassius’ fears proceeds turn Caesar’s body Antony set instructions funeral speech. It uncommon body man transgressed state left unburied City Square. The family would dishonored watch unconsecrated body loved one eaten dogs picked birds. The conspirators, seeing Caesar enemy state, would justified leaving Caesar’s body square, agreement allow proper burial generous concession. Brutus instructs Antony “prepare” clean Caesar’s body, wrap fresh shroud following pulpit Brutus plans speak. Left alone, Antony finally reveals true feelings toward men calls “butchers.” Calling gods, Antony curses conspirators Rome. Using images bloody brutal, Antony invokes spirit Caesar vows revenge Caesar’s murder unleashing devastating destructive forces hell. As though prayers immediately answered, servant enters news Octavius Caesar, Julius’ grandnephew, living relative heir, within 21 miles Rome. Julius may dead another Caesar moves quickly assume role take place.

However, Shakespeare taken dramatic license compressed approximately six weeks events single scene takes place Forum. During five days Caesar’s death funeral, actual conspirators quick place positions powers, assigning heads provinces Macedonia, Syria, Asia Minor. Shakespeare’s version story conspirators going directly Forum explain angry crowd felt necessary eliminate Caesar. This scene one brilliant examples dramatic literature power words manipulate intellect emotion. As planned, Brutus first speak. Caesar’s Forum. Ronald Sheridan/Ancient Art & Architecture Collection Ltd. Brutus’ speech written simple, balanced prose, much logical straightforward style poetry. He begins reminding people honorable man assumes crowd make connection honorable man honorably motivated deed. Shakespeare creates rhythm Brutus’ speech use parallelism (the repetition words, phrases sentences grammatical structure). This rhetorical tool used reinforce idea concept making memorable audience, Brutus weakens case relying merely technical tools make suit crowd. Brutus’ speech void passion, appealing crowd’s sense reason mistakenly deeming intellectual equals. His questions crowd rhetorical nature; thus, answer really expected. Politicians orators often use rhetorical questioning manipulate audience believing made minds issue actually already decided them. Rather aiming reach mob’s emotions personal level, Brutus appeals abstract ideal patriotism offers sacrifice Rome. The bottom line, however, one explanation offered justify need Caesar’s assassination: He ambitious. Brutus makes attempt explain ways Caesar ambitious expects crowd take word honorable man. CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act III, Scene 2 Again, Brutus demonstrates almost absurd inability read people situations. He wants believe common people Rome noble, moral people unquestioning sense patriotism but, seen opening scene play, case. The commoners often coarse, easily manipulated, interested personal pleasures public politics. It obvious crowd grasp reasoning behind actions conspirators offer crown Brutus, erect statues him, declare, “Let Caesar.” Ironically, crowd seeks replace Caesar man killed him; create new dictator one attempted eliminate previous one. Brutus, however, chooses ignore callings and, feeling sufficiently convinced crowd action conspirators necessary, confidently naively, leaves pulpit Antony. His trust Antony misplaced trust mob him. The exact climax Julius Caesar debated years. Some feel actual murder Caesar climax, whereas others contend turning point occurs Antony turns crowd conspirators. Obviously, death Caesar moment emotional intensity could qualify defining moment play, instant greatest intensity suspense occurs Antony stirs crowd frenzy downfall conspirators becomes inevitable. Antony claims great orator, funeral speech three times longer one given Brutus will, emotionally effective use poetry, move people Rome violent acts rage. As begins speak, Antony difficult task commanding attention crowd set purpose. He first addressing friends assuring intention 113 bury Caesar. It obvious next line speech Antony listened carefully Brutus’ speech found explanation Caesar’s ambition weak one. He picks word, repeating consistently, begins prove contrary. He also, keeping instructions Brutus given him, reminds crowd Brutus honorable man. By alternating ironic references Brutus’ honor nobility real evidence Caesar’s lack ambition, Antony forces crowd understand subtext words without violating conspirators’ instructions speak ill them. Without violating rules established Brutus, Antony destroys Brutus’ argument, Caesar ambitious. Unlike Brutus’ speech, seemed almost sterile, planned, memorized, Antony’s speech suggests spontaneous approach, attention paid effect words audience. When suspects completely undermined Brutus’ singular argument Caesar ambitious, Antony begins weep openly fallen friend. A man held high regard moves crowd silence sympathy public display emotion. Although Antony’s tears may shed purposely sway crowd purposes, grief loss Caesar appears genuine feelings fuel speech thus, enflame crowd. After Caesar’s assassination, Mark Antony rouses mob impassioned eulogy. Mary Evans Picture Library 114 Act III, Scene 2 Even though Antony convinced crowd Caesar ambitious conspirators honorable men, finished. If intent letting “slip dogs war” work do. Historically, Antony, convinced Calpurnia give free access Caesar’s papers, found Caesar’s evening assassination. He intends use effort manipulate crowd appealing greedy nature. Having mentioned will, crowd is, course, filled curiosity Antony declines read insistent crowd becomes. Antony’s next ploy enrage crowd draws sentimentality use visual aids. Closing Caesar’s body, Antony shows Caesar’s torn bloody robe awed crowd. He tells Caesar wore cloak conquest Nervii remembers first time Caesar put robe. The Nervii barbaric tribe living Gaul but, CliffsComplete Julius Caesar considering Antony join Caesar Gaul three years defeat Nervii, highly unlikely actually remembered particular battle, much less particular robe. He goes point tear mantle identify man made particular rent. Because Trebonius taken Antony away Capitol assassination, making sure nowhere near, impossible Antony know information. But questioned, crowd enraptured every word. Moving cut claims Brutus made, Antony describes “the unkindest cut all.” If, Plutarch suggests, Brutus stabbed Caesar genitals, perhaps accurate statement Antony made past lines. Before Brutus left Capitol, turned body Caesar Antony, instructed Antony “prepare body.” By that, Brutus meant Antony bathe Caesar’s body, dress wounds would seep, wrap body fresh shroud. But Antony intentionally chose this. He leaves Caesar’s body condition found it, shows pitiful sight crowd. In highly charged moment, people Rome moved tears rage sorrow, Antony yet quite satisfied crowd’s emotional intensity. Now moment remind people Caesar’s contents. Informing crowd Caesar’s generosity explosive fuel enflames mob frenzy Antony desires. The image fire means destruction purification powerfully intermingled violence chaos unleashed final part scene. As Caesar’s body sanctified ritual cremation, crowd takes firebrands funeral pyre burn homes conspirators. Brutus Cassius, along conspirators, forced escape Rome, city desired free.

The word “peace” shouted mangled body slain leader, Portia maim leg effort live father’s name, crowds content let Brutus “Caesar.” The name, reality beneath it, takes almost mythical proportions. In addition showing consequences violent bloodthirsty mob, Shakespeare might chosen particular episode Plutarch illustrate points well. An issue turns many Shakespeare’s plays importance name.

Again, Shakespeare seems draw comparison forces Antony Octavius Brutus Cassius. Although evidence power struggles beginning Antony Octavius previous scene, two men remain united purposes. This scene clearly establishes fact relationship Brutus Cassius seriously deteriorated, reflecting larger picture discord within republican cause. The issue friendship pervades Julius Caesar especially evident scene next. The word “love” variants occurs fifty-six times course play Brutus discloses friendship Cassius “cooling” love begun “sicken decay.” The breech two men direct result conflict realist idealist. Even horrific aftermath assassination, Brutus lost naivete, personal principles still take precedence personal relationships. Brutus’ preoccupation situations appear others obviously still great concern him. When Cassius publicly accuses Brutus wrongdoing, Brutus cuts admonishes speaking candidly armies.

The poet Leonard Digges, poem included Introduction 1623 First Folio, mentions “parlying Romans” longer version poem printed 1640 edition Shakespeare’s Poems writes: So I seene, Cesar would appeare, And Stage half-sword parley were, Brutus Cassius: Oh Audience, Were ravish’d, wonder went thence. . . . Even eighteenth nineteenth centuries play Julius Caesar considered many critics one Shakespeare’s lesser plays, quarrel scene Brutus Cassius thought shining example Shakespeare’s better work. Samuel Johnson, like play, called scene one “universally celebrated,” poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge cited scene evidence Shakespeare’s “genius superhuman.” The inevitable clash Cassius’ cynical realism Brutus’ stubborn idealism makes excellent drama also brings light larger issues morality ethics within rebellion. Cassius well aware takes money maintain army always possible obtain needed funds honorable ways. Cassius sees nothing wrong, circumstances, whatever necessary, including overlooking “nice offence” bribery, secure money needed support men army. Instead viewing Cassius’ fundraising activities necessary evils time war, Brutus, impaired blinders nobility, see corruption. Later scene, Brutus, condemned Cassius obtaining money extortion, castigates Cassius sharing spoils efforts. Ironically, Brutus, accusing Cassius contaminating “our fingers base bribes,” fails recognize participation corruption insisted conspirators contaminate fingers blood murdered Caesar. In lines 38–47, Brutus accuses Cassius “choleric.” Elizabethans believed emotional stability along general health depended proper balance four fluids humours within body. The four cardinal humours blood, phlegm, choler (yellow bile), melancholy (black bile), thought mixtures elements would determine person’s temperament. A well-proportioned mixture four elements would result person balanced healthy. However, person predominance one fluid produced someone either sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, melancholic. The choleric man, Cassius Brutus’ opinion, would quick anger, lean, arrogant, ambitious, malicious, sly. The argument two men disintegrates almost pathetic childlike squabble. For moment, Brutus replaces stoic nature one petulance becomes man torments, intimidates, belittles man calls friend. Cassius questions Brutus’ definition friendship suggests true friend would chronicle every fault friend later “cast” every mistake “into teeth.” Brutus’ arrogance becomes exaggerated declarations become reminiscent ones spoken Caesar right death. Just Caesar referred terms Olympian god Act III, Brutus, using term, takes identical tones pomposity conceit. Shakespeare continues draw parallel Brutus Caesar and, point, would difficult distinguish one man other. Just exposed chest storm Act I, Cassius offers “naked breast” Brutus’ dagger. Just bears chest, Cassius man openly bears soul. Unlike Brutus, Cassius cannot hide feelings behind philosophy. He “aweary world,” exhaustion comes efforts behalf freedom Rome also constantly trying prove love Brutus. On every occasion, foresworn better judgment CliffsComplete Julius Caesar effort placate Brutus. He done dirty work required keep armies intact now, Brutus nothing condemn accuse place Cassius, declaring superiority ethically morally. As quarrel comes end, passionate Cassius appears beaten forlorn but, expected, Cassius swallows pride instigates reconciliation two men. The entrance poet scene moment episode comic relief. According Plutarch, poet entered fray cynic philosopher name Marcus Phaonius, actor playing poet was, often speculated, William Shakespeare himself, scene takes complex meaning. As evidenced Act III, poets prosper times civil unrest. Cinna torn limb limb and, although poet walks away life, insulted harshly dismissed. The message brought poet two generals simple powerful one: “Love friends.” The job poet uncover truth beauty, truth revealed short scene importance love: love friends, love country, love proper ideals. Since funeral speech, one mentioned love Rome love freedom. Love individuals replaced ambition petty concerns and, result, world odds brink destruction. Instead listening poet however, Brutus labels empty, vulgar fool ignores important theme presented play: “to love friends.” Following exit poet, Brutus reveals wife, Portia, died. According Plutarch, Portia killed putting hot coals mouth, Shakespeare’s description “swallowing fire” enforces continuing imagery destruction fire. Brutus’ stoicism evident telling wife’s death, possible sorrow grief cause uncharacteristic show emotion quarreled Cassius. Almost soon Brutus told Cassius Portia’s death, Messala enters report news Portia’s death Brutus. The retelling information seems almost unnecessary detail within scene. Many scholars speculate Shakespeare revised play, writing first telling Portia’s death (lines 147–156) Act IV, Scene 3 139 replace second (lines 179–192) attempt avoid making Brutus look totally emotionless, printer failed delete second passage. Closer examination, however, might point second telling way revealing Brutus’ character. Messala enters scene accompanied Titinius. Cassius, still shock Portia’s demise, verbally laments death quieted Brutus with, “No more, I pray you.” Brutus goes deny news Portia, telling Cassius death and, Messala tells death, Brutus’ response calm point uncaring. Brutus, always concerned public image, could put show stoic resignation impress Messala, knowing word response would spread camp and, indeed, Messala calls Brutus great man. By point, Shakespeare merged characters Brutus Caesar Brutus’ words, rather reminiscent Caesar’s words, begin echo exact thoughts. For example, Act II, Caesar remarks “death, necessary end, / Will come come.” Brutus Act IV declares, “We must die, Messala. / With meditating must die once, / I patience endure now.” The retelling Portia’s death, rather compositor’s error, allows Shakespeare continue thematically metamorphose two men one. Messala also brings news deaths senators proscribed Antony Octavius. Although Messala reports death 100 senators, Brutus heard 70. Again, confusion reigns war within ranks Brutus’ Cassius’ armies. Messala also tells death Cicero. Marc Antony ordered death Cicero and, even though Cicero one Octavius’ early supporters, Octavius agreed list Cicero death. Knowing marked death, Cicero tried escape Italy ship sailing blown back shore. Instead making another attempt escape, Cicero waited soldiers sent kill without resistance, died hands December 43 B.C. The next order business discussion military strategy. Because Antony Octavius known advancing towards Phillipi, Brutus suggests march armies meet there. 140 CliffsComplete Julius Caesar Act IV, Scene 3 Cassius, experienced soldier, disagrees, arguing logically stay are, soldiers rested better able battle. Brutus’ ever expanding ego intervenes vetoes Cassius’ idea saying, “Good reasons must force give place better.” Brutus behaves dictatorially brazen over-confidence makes difficult differentiate tyranny dead Caesar tyranny living Brutus. Cassius makes feeble attempt speak matter Brutus refuses listen. Instead, emotes importance acting moment right. Ironically, course, Brutus yet ever act proper time Shakespeare’s theory holds true time, Brutus’ relationship it, remains kilter. Brutus become anachronism. fact ghost identifies evil would proof Brutus is, least subconsciously, aware murder Caesar ensuing chaos immoral. The second interpretation Caesar’s ghost would actual apparition. Both Romans Elizabethans superstitious people unequivocally believed existence ghosts. Either interpretation, however, serves show Brutus, like Caesar death, become superstitious. It fulfillment Antony’s prophecy Caesar’s spirit “come hot hell” foreshadows defeat republican forces death Brutus Phillipi. After everyone leaves tent, Brutus dons nightgown literally transforms public image private self. As Portia Act II, Brutus drops mask stoic politician becomes caring, concerned man admit mistakes find humor situation. In short segment almost domestic bliss, becomes obvious Brutus much suited pleasures home perils politics. In real sense, seems man forced role made play. Into short-lived moment peace comes ghost Julius Caesar. The episode, rather invention Shakespeare’s dramatic imagination, actually taken Plutarch’s record events. In accounting, Plutarch relates ghost identified Brutus’ “evil spirit.” There least two possible ways interpreting appearance Caesar’s ghost. The first would portray ghost manifestation Brutus’ troubled mind guilty conscience. Brutus exhausted angry episode Cassius full grief death Portia. The recent deaths senators, inevitable deaths occur upcoming battles, possibility death cannot far Brutus’ thoughts. If ghost outward form Brutus’ conscience, Julius Caesar.

A small skirmish actually ensued opposing forces Antony Octavius Brutus Cassius battle scene takes place. The result armies conspiracy, although outnumbered Antony’s Octavius’ army, commandeered strategically superior location. Positioned high hills, Brutus Cassius could victorious simply delaying action Antony Octavius’ armies tried exist unprotected swampy plains area. From Octavius’ first speech, becomes clear Brutus Cassius made characteristically unwise decision descend hills onto plains Antony amazed thankful turn events. Antony believes conspirators attacking rather waiting progression events look cowardly. Based Antony’s conjecture, previous examples Brutus’ military acumen, would difficult guess made decision move hills onto plains Phillipi. Antony gives Octavius orders fight left side field, and, first overt sign dissension two men, Octavius argues Antony insisting one fight left side. Octavius eventually concedes Antony’s command fight left, warns Antony matter, “I cross you; I so.” Indeed, Octavius keep word triumphs Antony Shakespeare’s telling Antony Cleopatra. Brutus’ call “Words blows” tradition medieval Roman; medieval times, customary exchange insults battle. The tradition allows Shakespeare establish animosity two sides using verbal rather physical combat. The task producing battle scene small stage limited number actors always difficult. By using verbal assault, rapid action, swift scene changes, one-on-one combat, Shakespeare able create illusion larger battle. The exchange would also entertain Elizabethan audience quick biting wit. Octavius hurls threats insults Brutus Cassius swears meant die upon Brutus’ sword. Brutus replies, “O, thou wert noblest 150 Act V, Scene 1 thy strain, / Young man, thou couldst die honourable.” Even face battle real possibility death, Brutus’ conceit humbled. Brutus has, essence, become Caesar; Octavius, longer referred Octavius, taken name Caesar. Indeed, spirit Julius Caesar metaphorically possessed men, ghost roams fields Philippi, Caesar’s influence even powerful efficacious death life.

He longer Cassius Act I. In beginning, Machiavellian-type character able deviously persuade Brutus join conspiracy. Caesar saw dangerous man observed much spent much time thought. From rather cold calculating introduction, shrewd passionate man emerged. Cassius loyal man treasures friendships, underestimates worth, he, too, often represses better judgment — dire consequences. As witnesses imminent failure dreams conspiracy, Cassius, acknowledging part abject silence played, consumed depression. Throughout entire play, Cassius consistently bends Brutus.

Julius Caesar CLIFFSCOMPLETE READING GROUP DISCUSSION GUIDE Use following questions topics enhance reading group discussions. The discussion help get thinking — hopefully talking — Shakespeare whole new way! DISCUSSION QUESTIONS 1. Throughout Julius Caesar, view many characters’ actions influenced choice (or free ), influenced fate (or destiny), influenced supernatural forces. Which Brutus’ actions seem come free will? Which seem come destiny? What actions seem influenced supernatural forces? What actions Caesar? Cassius? Antony? What relationship free will, destiny, supernatural forces Shakespeare suggest? 2. Julius Caesar features large cast supporting characters. Why Shakespeare include characters Casca? Cinna? Lepidus? Calpurnia? Pindarus? Portia? What characters add play? How would play different took away characters? 3. If producing new stage film ver- sion Julius Caesar, would cast role Julius Caesar? Should actor playing role older (in 60s 70s) weary? Or middle-aged still energetic spry? How would costume him? Does costume make look out-of-shape robust? How casting costuming Caesar affect meaning entire play? 4. Although many members Shakespeare’s orig- inal audience believed supernatural forces, far fewer modern audience members do. In fact, recent productions Julius Caesar cut supernatural elements (the soothsayer, storm Caesar’s murder, on) play effort focus drama changes within characters’ minds. Are supernatural elements play necessary modern audience? What benefits cutting supernatural elements play? What play lose? 5. It said good leader inspires fol- lowers based common philosophy ideal, weak leader inspires followers based leader’s charismatic personality personal strengths. Given definition, good leader Caesar? What Brutus? Cassius? Antony? Octavius? Which modern political business leaders inspire followers work common philosophy? 6. Female characters — particularly Portia Calpurnia — Julius Caesar seem secondary importance play, even though many opinions strong fears become reality. Where play women taken seriously? What consequences characters disregarding fear opinions? What might Shakespeare saying role women Roman society? In politics general? 7. For business political leaders, public demands often ruin personal relationships. CliffsComplete Reading Group Discussion Guide Likewise, leader’s personal life affect ability publicly lead. What personal relationships destroyed Julius Caesar? Which public images destroyed play? What might Shakespeare saying relationship leaders’ public private lives? Is balance public private life ever possible? 8. Although many characters actions within Julius Caesar rooted history, successful productions play set time periods locations different specified Shakespeare original work. For example, productions Julius Caesar set Nazi Germany, 1930s Chicago meatpacking factory, even outer space. What play lose it’s set time period different historical roots? What play gain? What characters, lines, scenes would need cut rewritten fit changes time period location? 177 9. Because character Julius Caesar dies early play, readers critics suggested appropriate title Julius Caesar might Brutus. In way Brutus’ story focus Julius Caesar? Why might Shakespeare chosen Julius Caesar title play? How Caesar influence half play appear? Is better title play? 10. Some productions Julius Caesar cut Antony’s Octavius’ lines end play. Other productions cut final entrance together end play Brutus’ final speech suicide. How important Antony Octavius’ final presence end Julius Caesar? What pros cons ending play Brutus’ suicide? Is play still tragedy without Antony Octavius final scene?
