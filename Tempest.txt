E n c h a n t e d I s l a n d.
A COMEDY.

PREFACE TO THE ENCHANTED ISLAND.
The writing of Prefaces to Plays was probably invented by some very
ambitious Poet, who never thought he had done enough: Perhaps by some
Ape of the French Eloquence, which uses to make a business of a Letter of
gallantry, an examen of a Farce; and in short, a great pomp and ostentation
of words on every trifle. This is certainly the talent of that Nation, and
ought not to be invaded by any other. They do that out of gayety which
would be an imposition upon us.
We may satisfie our selves with surmounting them in the Scene, and
safely leave them those trappings of writing, and flourishes of the Pen, with
which they adorn the borders of their Plays, and which are indeed no more
than good Landskips to a very indifferent Picture. I must proceed no farther
in this argument, lest I run my self beyond my excuse for writing this. Give
me leave therefore to tell you, Reader, that I do it not to set a value on any
thing I have written in this Play, but out of gratitude to the memory of Sir
William Davenant, who did me the honour to joyn me with him in the
alteration of it.
It was originally Shakespear’s: a Poet for whom he had particularly a
high veneration, and whom he first taught me to admire. The Play it self
had formerly been acted with success in the Black-Fryers: and our excellent
Fletcher had so great a value for it, that he thought fit to make use of the
same Design, not much varied, a second time. Those who have seen his SeaVoyage, may easily discern that it was a Copy of Shakespear’s Tempest: the
Storm, the desart Island, and the Woman who had never seen a Man, are
all sufficient testimonies of it. But Fletcher was not the only Poet who made
use of Shakespear’s Plot: Sir John Suckling, a profess’d admirer of our
Author, has follow’d his footsteps in his Goblins; his Regmella being an
open imitation of Shakespear’s Miranda; and his Spirits, though
counterfeit, yet are copied from Ariel. But Sir William Davenant, as he was
a man of quick and piercing imagination, soon sound that somewhat might
be added to the Design of Shakespear, of which neither Fletcher nor
Suckling had ever thought: and therefore to put the last hand to it, he
design’d the Counterpart to Shakespear’s Plot, namely that of a Man who
had never seen a Woman; that by this means those two Characters of
Innocence and Love might the more illustrate and commend each other.

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

This excellent contrivance he was pleas’d to communicate to me, and to
desire my assistance in it. I confess that from the very first moment it so
pleas’d me, that I never writ any thing with more delight. I must likewise do
him that justice to acknowledge, that my writing received daily his
amendments, and that is the reason why it is not so faulty, as the rest which
I have done without the help or correction of so judicious a friend. The
Comical parts of the Saylors were also his invention, and for the most part
his writing, as you will easily discover by the style. In the time I writ with
him I had the opportunity to observe somewhat more neerly of him than I
had formerly done, when I had only a bare acquaintance with him: I found
him then of so quick a fancy, that nothing was propos’d to him, on which
he could not suddenly produce a thought extreamly pleasant and
surprizing: and those first thoughts of his, contrary to the old Latine
Proverb, were not alwaies the least happy. And as his fancy was quick, so
likewise were the products of it remote and new. He borrowed not of any
other; and his imaginations were such as could not easily enter into any
other man. His corrections were sober and judicious: and he corrected his
own writings much more severely than those of another man, bestowing
twice the time and labour in polishing which he us’d in invention. It had
perhaps been easie enough for me to have arrogated more to my self than
was my due in the writing of this Play, and to have pass’d by his name with
silence in the publication of it, with the same ingratitude which others have
us’d to him, whose Writings he hath not only corrected, as he has done this,
but has had a greater inspection over them, and sometimes added whole
Scenes together, which may as easily be distinguish’d from the rest, as true
Gold from counterfeit by the weight. But besides the unworthiness of the
action which deterred me from it (there being nothing so base as to rob the
dead of his reputation) I am satisfi’d I could never have receiv’d so much
honour in being thought the Author of any Poem how excellent soever, as
I shall from the joining my imperfections with the merit and name of
Shakespear and Sir William Davenant.

Prologue to the Tempest, or the Enchanted Island.

Decemb. 1.
1669.
JOHN DRIDEN.

As when a Tree’s cut down the secret root
Lives under ground, and thence new Branches shoot
So, from old Shakespear’s honour’d dust, this day
Springs up and buds a new reviving Play.
Shakespear, who (taught by none) did first impart
To Fletcher Wit, to labouring Johnson Art.
He, Monarch-like, gave those his subjects law,
And is that Nature which they paint and draw.
Fletcher reach’d that which on his heights did grow,
Whilst Johnson crept and gather’d all below.
This did his Love, and this his Mirth digest:
One imitates him most, the other best.
If they have since out-writ all other men,
’Tis with the drops which fell from Shakespear’s Pen.
The Storm which vanish’d on the Neighb’ring shore,
Was taught by Shakespear’s Tempest first to roar.
That innocence and beauty which did smile
In Fletcher, grew on this Enchanted Isle.
But Shakespear’s Magick could not copy’d be,
Within that Circle none durst walk but he.
I must confess ’twas bold, nor would you now,
That liberty to vulgar Wits allow,
Which works by Magick supernatural things:
But Shakespear’s pow’r is sacred as a King’s.
Those Legends from old Priest-hood were receiv’d,
And he then writ, as people then believ’d.
But, if for Shakespear we your grace implore,
We for our Theatre shall want it more:
Who by our dearth of Youths are forc’d t’employ
One of our Women to present a Boy.
And that’s a transformation you will say
Exceeding all the Magick in the Play.
Let none expect in the last Act to find,
Her Sex transform’d from man to Woman-kind.
What e’re she was before the Play began,
All you shall see of her is perfect man.
Or if your fancy will be farther led,
To find her Woman, it must be abed.

Quarter-Master, get’s more Nippers.

GONZALO
Good friend, remember whom thou hast aboard.

GONZALO
I have great comfort from this Fellow; methinks his complexion is perfect
Gallows; stand fast, good fate, to his hanging; make the Rope of his destiny
our Cable, for our own does little advantage us; if he be not born to be
hang’d we shall be drown’d.

Enter Mustacho.

TRINCALO
A curse upon this howling,
[A great cry within.
They are louder than the weather.
[Enter Antonio and Gonzalo.
Yet again, what do you here! shall we give o’re, and drown? [75] ha’ you a
mind to sink?

MUSTACHO
Loose the main Top-sail!
STEPHANO
Furle him again, there’s too much Wind.

GONZALO
A Pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, uncharitable dog.

TRINCALO
Loose Fore-sail! Haul Aft both sheats! trim her right afore the Wind. Aft!
Aft! Lads, and hale up the Misen here.
MUSTACHO

Work you then.
ANTONIO
Hang, Cur, hang, you whorson insolent noise-maker, we are less afraid to
be drown’d than thou art.

STEPHANO WITHIN
Port hard, port! the Wind grows scant, bring the Tack aboard Port is. Starboard, star-board, a little steady; now steady, keep her thus, no neerer you

thee: Alas! I suffer justly for my crimes, but why thou shouldest—O Heaven!
[A cry within.
Heark, farewel my Son! a long farewel!

MUSTACHO
O Master! six foot Water in Hold.
STEPHANO
Clap the Helm hard aboard! Flat, flat, flat in the Fore-sheat there.

FERDINAND

TRINCALO
What must our mouths be cold then?

STEPHANO
he strikes, she strikes! All shift for themselves.

VENTOSO
All’s lost. To prayers, to prayers.

PROSPERO
Miranda! where’s your Sister?
MIRANDA
I left her looking from the pointed Rock, at the walk end, on the huge beat
of Waters.

MUSTACHO
Nay, we may e’ne pray too; our case is now alike.
ANTONIO
We are meerly cheated of our lives by Drunkards.
[100] This wide chopt Rascal: would thou might’st lye drowning
The long washing of ten Tides.
[Exeunt Trincalo, Mustacho, and Ventoso.
GONZALO
He’ll he hang’d yet, though every drop of water swears against it; now
would I give ten thousand Furlongs of Sea for one Acre of barren ground,
Long-heath, Broom-furs, or any thing. The wills above be done, but I would
fain dye a dry death.
[A confused noise within.
ANTONIO
Mercy upon us! we split, we split.

PROSPERO
It is a dreadful object.
MIRANDA
If by your Art, my dearest Father, you have put them in this roar, allay ’em
quickly.
Had I been any God of power, I would have sunk the Sea into the Earth,
before it should the Vessel so have swallowed.
PROSPERO
Collect your self, and tell your piteous heart,
There’s no harm done.
MIRANDA
O woe the day!

[Exeunt.

Enter Stephano, Trincalo.
TRINCALO
The Ship is sinking.

[Exeunt.

Enter Prospero and Miranda.

GONZALO
The Duke and Prince are gone within to prayers.
Let’s assist them.

GONZALO
Let’s all sink with the Duke, and the young Prince.

11

[A new cry within.

STEPHANO
Run her ashore!
TRINCALO
Lusse! lusse! or we are all lost! there’s a Rock upon the Star-board Bow.

PROSPERO
[125] There is no harm:
I have done nothing but in care of thee,
My Daughter, and thy pretty Sister:
You both are ignorant of what you are,
Not knowing whence I am, nor that I’m more
Than Prospero, Master of a narrow Cell,
And thy unhappy Father.
MIRANDA
I ne’re indeavour’d to know more than you were pleas’d to tell me.
PROSPERO
I should inform thee farther: wipe thou thine Eyes, have comfort; the
direful spectacle of the wrack, which touch’d the very virtue of compassion

12

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

in thee, I have with such a pity safely order’d, that not one creature in the
Ship is lost.

MIRANDA
O Heavens! what foul play had we, that we hither came, or was’t a blessing
that we did?

MIRANDA
ou often, Sir, began to tell me what I am,
But then you stopt.
PROSPERO
The hour’s now come; Obey, and be attentive, Canst thou remember a time
before we came into this Cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wert
not full three years old.
MIRANDA
Certainly I can, Sir.
PROSPERO
Tell me the image then of any thing which thou dost keep in thy
remembrance still.
MIRANDA
Sir, had I not four or five Women once that tended me?
PROSPERO
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda: what see’st thou else in the dark backward, and abyss of Time?
[150] If thou remembrest ought e’re thou cam’st here, then, how thou cam’st
thou may’st emember too.
MIRANDA
Sir, that I do not.
PROSPERO
Fifteen Years since, Miranda, thy Father was the Duke of Millan, and a
Prince of power.
MIRANDA
Sir, are not you my Father?
PROSPERO
Thy Mother was all virtue, and she said, thou wast my Daughter, and thy
Sister too.

13

PROSPERO
Both, both, my Girl.
MIRANDA
How my heart bleeds to think what you have suffer’d. But, Sir, I pray
proceed.
PROSPERO
y Brother, and thy Uncle, call’d Antonio, to whom I trusted then the
manage of my State, while I was wrap’d with secret Studies: That false
Uncle (do’st thou attend me Child?)
MIRANDA
Sir, most heedfully.
PROSPERO
Having attain’d the craft of granting suits, and of denying them; whom to
advance, or lop, for over-toping, soon was grown the Ivy which did hide my
Princely Trunck, and suckt my verdure out: thou attend’st not.
MIRANDA
O good Sir, I do.
PROSPERO
I thus neglecting worldly ends, and bent to closeness, and the bettering of
my mind, wak’d in my false Brother an evil Nature:
[175] He did believe
He was indeed the Duke, because he then did execute the outward face of
Soveraignty. Do’st thou still mark me?
MIRANDA
Your story would cure deafness.
PROSPERO
To have no screen between the part he plaid, and whom he plaid it for; he
needs would be Absolute Millan, and Confederates (so dry he was for Sway)
with Savoy’s Duke, to give him Tribute, and to do him homage.

14

Dryden and Davenant

MIRANDA
False man!
PROSPERO
This Duke of Savoy being an Enemy,
To me inveterate, strait grants my Brother’s suit,
And on a night
Mated to his design, Antonio opened the Gates of Millan, and i’th’ dead of
darkness, hurri’d me thence with thy young Sister, and thy crying self.
MIRANDA
But wherefore did they not that hour destroy us?
PROSPERO
They durst not, Girl, in Millan, For the love my people bore me; in short,
they hurri’d us away to Savoy, and thence aboard a Bark at Nissa’s Port:
bore us some Leagues to Sea, where they prepar’d a rotten Carkass of a
Boat, not rigg’d, no Tackle, Sail, nor Mast; the very Rats instinctively had
quit it: they hoisted us, to cry to Seas which roar’d to us; to sigh to Winds,
whose pity sighing back again, did seem to do us loving wrong.
MIRANDA
Alack! what trouble was I then to you?
PROSPERO
[200] Thou and thy Sister were two Cherubins, which did preserve me: you
both did smile, infus’d with fortitude from Heaven.
MIRANDA
How came we ashore?
PROSPERO
By Providence Divine, Some food we had, and some fresh Water, which a
Noble man of Savoy, called Gonzalo, appointed Master of that black
design, gave us; with rich Garments, and all necessaries, which since have
steaded much: and of his gentleness (knowing I lov’d my Books) he furnisht
me from mine own Library, with Volumes which I prize above my
Dukedom.
MIRANDA
Would I might see that man.

The Tempest

15

PROSPERO
Here in this Island we arriv’d, and here have I your Tutor been. But by my
skill I find that my mid-Heaven doth depend on a most happy Star, whose
influence if I now court not, but omit, my Fortunes will ever after droop:
here cease more question, thou art inclin’d to sleep: ’tis a good dulness, and
give it way; I know thou canst not chuse.
[She falls asleep.
Come away my Spirit: I am ready now, approach
My Ariel, Come.
[Enter Ariel.
ARIEL
All hail great Master, grave Sir, hail, I come to answer thy best pleasure, be
it to fly, to swim, to shoot into the fire, to ride on the curl’d Clouds; to thy
strong bidding, task Ariel and all his qualities.
PROSPERO
Hast thou, Spirit, perform’d to point the Tempest that [225] I bad thee?
ARIEL
To every Article. I boarded the Duke’s Ship, now on the Beak, now in the
Waste, the Deck, in every Cabin; I flam’d amazement, and sometimes I
seem’d to burn in many places on the Top-Mast, the Yards and Bore-sprit;
I did flame distinctly.
PROSPERO
May brave Spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil did not infect
his Reason?
ARIEL
Not a soul But felt a Feaver of the mind, and play’d some tricks of
desperation; all, but Mariners, plung’d in the foaming brine, and quit the
Vessel: the Duke’s Son, Ferdinand, with hair upstairing (more like Reeds
than Hair) was the first man that leap’d; cry’d, Hell is empty, and all the
Devils are here.
PROSPERO
Why that’s my Spirit;
But was not this nigh Shore?
ARIEL
Close by my Master.
PROSPERO
But, Ariel, are they safe?

16

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

17

What is’t thou canst demand?
ARIEL
Not a hair perisht.
In Troops I have dispers’d them round this Isle. The Duke’s Son I have
landed by himself, whom I have left warming the air with sighs, in an odde
angle of the Isle, and sitting, his arms he folded in this sad knot.
PROSPERO
Say how thou hast dispos’d the Mariners of the Duke’s [250] Ship, and all the
rest of the Fleet.
ARIEL
Safely in Harbour
Is the Duke’s Ship, in the deep Nook, where once thou call’dst
Me up at midnight to fetch Dew from the
Still vext Bermoothes, there she’s hid,
The Mariners all under hatches stow’d,
Whom, with a charm, join’d to their suffer’d labour,
I have left asleep, and for the rest o’th’ Fleet
(Which I disperst) they all have met again,
And are upon the Mediterranean Float,
Bound sadly home for Italy;
Supposing that they saw the Duke’s Ship wrackt,
And his great person perish.
PROSPERO
Ariel, thy charge
Exactly is perform’d, but there’s more work:
What is the time o’th’ day?
ARIEL
Past the mid-season.
PROSPERO
At least two Glasses: the time tween six and now must by us both be spent
most preciously.
ARIEL
Is there more toyl? since thou dost give me pains, let me remember thee
what thou hast promis’d, which is not yet perform’d me.
PROSPERO
How now, Moodie?

ARIEL
My liberty.
PROSPERO
[275] Before the time be out? no more.
ARIEL
I prethee!
Remember I have done thee faithful service,
Told thee no lyes, made thee no mistakings,
Serv’d without or grudge, or grumblings:
Thou didst promise to bate me a full year.
PROSPERO
Dost thou forget
From what a torment I did free thee?
ARIEL
No.
PROSPERO
Thou dost, and think’st it much to tread the Ooze
Of the salt deep:
To run against the sharp wind of the North,
To do my business in the Veins of the Earth,
When it is bak’d with Frost.
ARIEL
I do not, Sir.
PROSPERO
Thou ly’st, malignant thing! hast thou forgot the foul Witch Sycorax, who
with age and envy was grown into a Hoop? hast thou forgot her?
ARIEL
No Sir!
PROSPERO
Thou hast; where was she born? speak, tell me.

18

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

ARIEL
Sir, in Argier.

ARIEL
I thank thee, Master.

PROSPERO
Oh, was she so! I must Once every Month recount what thou hast been,
which thou forgettest. This damn’d Witch Sycorax for mischiefs manifold,
and sorceries too terrible to enter humane hearing, from [300] Argier thou
knowst was banisht: but for one thing she did, they would not take her life:
is not this true?

PROSPERO
If thou more murmurest, I will rend an Oak,
And peg the in his knotty Entrails, till thou
Hast howld away twelve Winters more.

ARIEL
I Sir.
PROSPERO
This blew-ey’d Hag was hither brought with child,
And here was left by th’ Saylors, thou, my slave,
As thou report’st thy self, wast then her servant,
And ’cause thou wast a spirit too delicate
To act her earthy and ahborr’d commands;
Refusing her grand Hests, she did confine thee,
By help of her more potent Ministers,
(In her unmitigable rage) into a cloven Pine,
Within whose rist imprison’d, thou didst painfully
Remain a dozen years; within which space she dy’d,
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy
Groans, as fast as Mill-wheels strike.
Then was this Isle (save for two Brats, which she did
Litter here, the brutish Caliban, and his twin Sister,
Two freckel’d-hag-born Whelps) not honour’d with
A humane shape.
ARIEL
Yes! Caliban her Son, and Sycorax his Sister.
PROSPERO
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, and she that Sycorax, whom I now
keep in service. Thou best knowst what torment I did find thee in, thy
groans did make Wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts of ever angry
Bears, it was a torment to lay upon the damn’d, which Sycorax could ne’re
[325] again undo: It was my Art, when I arriv’d, and heard thee, that made
the Pine to gape and let thee out.

19

ARIEL
Pardon, Master,
I will be correspondent to command, and be
A gentle spirit.
PROSPERO
Do so, and after two days I’le discharge thee.
ARIEL
That’s my noble Master.
What shall I do? say? what? what shall I do?
PROSPERO
Be subject to no sight but mine; invisible to
Every eye-ball else: hence with diligence.
My daughter wakes. A non thou shalt know more.
Thou hast slept well my child.

[Ex. Ariel.

MIRANDA
The sadness of your story put heaviness in me.
PROSPERO
Shake it off; come on, I’le now call Caliban, my slave,
Who never yields us a kind answer.
MIRANDA
’Tis a creature, Sir, I do not love to look on.
PROSPERO
But as ’tis, we cannot miss him; he does make our Fire, fetch in our Wood,
and serve in Offices that profit us: what hoa! Slave! Caliban! thou Earth
thou, speak.
CALIBAN. WITHIN
There’s Wood enough within.

else this Isle with Calibans.
PROSPERO
Come forth, I say, there’s other business for thee.
[350] Come thou Tortoise, when?
Fine apparition, my quaint Ariel,
Hark in thy ear.
ARIEL
My Lord it shall be done.

[Enter Ariel.

[Exit.

PROSPERO
Thou poisonous Slave, got by the Devil himself upon thy wicked Dam, come
forth.
[Enter Caliban.
CALIBAN
As wicked Dew, as e’re my Mother brush’d with Raven’s Feather from
unwholsome Fens, drop on you both: A South-west blow on you, and blister
you all o’re.
PROSPERO
For this besure, to night thou shalt have Cramps, side-stitches, that shall
pen thy breath up; Urchins shall prick thee till thou bleed’st: thou shalt be
pinch’d as thick as Honey-Combs, each pinch more stinging than the Bees
which made ’em.
CALIBAN
I must eat my dinner: this Island’s mine by Sycorax my Mother, which thou
took’st from me. When thou cam’st first, thou stroak’st me, and mad’st
much of me, would’st give me Water with Berries in’t, and teach me how to
name the bigger Light, and how the less, that burn by day and night; and
then I lov’d thee, and shew’d thee all the qualities of the Isle, the freshSprings, brine-Pits, barren places, and fertil. Curs’d be I, that I did so: All
the Charms of Sycorax, Toads, Beetles, Batts, light on thee, for I am all the
Subjects that thou hast. I first was mine own Lord; and here thou stay’st me
in this hard Rock, whiles thou dost keep from me the rest o’th’ [375] Island.
PROSPERO
hou most lying Slave, whom stripes may move, not kindness: I have us’d
thee (filth that thou art) with humane care, and lodg’d thee in mine own
Cell, till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my Children.
CALIBAN
Oh ho, Oh ho, would t’had been done: thou did’st prevent me, I had peopl’d

PROSPERO
Abhor’d Slave! Who ne’re would any print of goodness take, being capable
of all ill: I pity’d thee, took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
one thing or other; when thou didst not (Savage) know thy own meaning,
but would’st gabble, like a thing most brutish, I endow’d thy purposes with
words which made them known: But thy wild race (though thou did’st
learn) had that in’t, which good Natures could not abide to be with:
therefore wast thou deservedly pent up into this Rock.
CALIBAN
You taught me language, and my profit by it is, that I know to curse: the red
botch rid you for learning me your language.
PROSPERO
Hag-seed hence!
Fetch us in fewel, and be quick
To answer other business: shrugst thou (malice)
If thou neglectest or dost unwillingly what I command,
I’le wrack thee with old Cramps, fill all thy bones with
Aches, make thee roar, that Beasts shall tremble
[400] At thy Din.
CALIBAN
No prethee!
I must obey. His Art is of such power,
It would controul my Dam’s God, Setebos,
And make a Vassal of him.
PROSPERO
So Slave, hence.

[Exeunt Prospero and Caliban severally.
Enter Dorinda.

DORINDA
Oh Sister! what have I beheld?
MIRANDA
hat is it moves you so?
DORINDA
From yonder Rock,

22

Dryden and Davenant

As I my Eyes cast down upon the Seas,
The whistling winds blew rudely on my face,
And the waves roar’d; at first I thought the War
Had bin between themselves, but strait I spy’d
A huge great Creature.
MIRANDA
O you mean the Ship.
DORINDA
Is’t not a Creature then? it seem’d alive.
MIRANDA
But what of it?
DORINDA
This floating Ram did bear his Horns above;
All ty’d with Ribbands, russling in the wind,
Sometimes he nodded down his head a while,
And then the Waves did heave him to the Moon;
He clamb’ring to the top of all the Billows,
And then again he curtsy’d down so low,
I could not see him: till, at last, all side long
With a great crack his belly burst in pieces.
MIRANDA
[425] There all had perisht
Had not my Father’s magick Art reliev’d them.
But, Sister, I have stranger news to tell you;
In this great Creature there were other Creatures,
And shortly we may chance to see that thing,
Which you have heard my Father call, a Man.
DORINDA
But what is that? for yet he never told me.
MIRANDA
I know no more than you: but I have heard
My Father say we Women were made for him.
DORINDA
What, that he should eat us Sister?

The Tempest

23

MIRANDA
No sure, you see my Father is a man, and yet
He does us good. I would he were not old.
DORINDA
Methinks indeed it would be finer, if we two
Had two young Fathers.
MIRANDA
No Sister, no, if they were young, my Father
Said that we must call them Brothers.
DORINDA
But pray how does it come that we two are not Brothers then, and have not
Beards like him?
MIRANDA
Now I confess you pose me.
DORINDA
How did he come to be our Father too?
MIRANDA
I think he found us when we both were little, and grew within the ground.
DORINDA
Why could he not find more of us? pray sister let you and I look up and
down one day, to find some little ones for us to play with.
MIRANDA
[450] Agreed; but now we must go in. This is the hour
Wherein my Father’s Charm will work,
Which seizes all who are in open Air:
Th’ effect of his great Art I long to see,
Which will perform as much as Magick can.
DORINDA
And I, methinks, more long to see a Man.

24

Dryden and Davenant

ACT II.
Enter Alonzo, Antonio, Gonzalo, Attendants.
GONZALO
BESEECH your Grace be merry; you have cause, so have we all, of joy for our
strange scape: then wisely, good Sir, weigh our sorrow with our comfort.
ALONZO
Prithee peace! you cram these words into my Ears against my stomack, how
can I rejoyce, when my dear Son, perhaps this very moment, is made a meal
to some strange Fish?
ANTONIO
Sir, he may live, I saw him beat the billows under him, and ride upon their
backs; he trod the Water, whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted the
most swoln surge that met him, his bold head ’bove the contentious waves
he kept, and oar’d himself with his strong arms to shore, I do not doubt he
came alive to land.
ALONZO
No, no, he’s gone, and you and I, Antonio, were those who caus’d his death.
ANTONIO
How could we help it?
ALONZO
Then, then, we should have helpt it, when thou betrayedst thy Brother
Prospero, and Mantua’s Infant, Sovereign to my power: And when I, too
ambitious, took by force anothers right; then lost we Ferdinand, then
forfeited our Navy to this Tempest.
ANTONIO
Indeed we first broke truce with Heav’n;
You to the waves an Infant Prince expos’d,
And on the waves have lost an only Son;
[25] I did usurp my Brother’s fertile lands, and now
Am cast upon this desert Isle.
GONZALO
These, Sir, ’tis true, were crimes of a black Dye,
But both of you have made amends to Heav’n,

The Tempest

25

By your late Voyage into Portugal,
Where, in defence of Christianity,
Your valour has repuls’d the Moors of Spain.
ALONZO
O name it not, Gonzalo.
No act but penitence can expiate guilt,
Must we teach Heaven what price to set on Murthers?
What rate on lawless power, and wild ambition?
Or dare we traffick with the Powers above,
And sell by weight a good deed for a bad?

[Musick within.

GONZALO
Musick! and in the air! sure we are shipwrackt on the Dominions of some
merry Devil.
ANTONIO
This Isle’s inchanted ground, for I have heard
Swift voices flying by my Ear, and groans
Of lamenting Ghosts.
ALONZO
I pull’d a Tree, and Blood pursu’d my hand; O Heaven! deliver me from this
dire dare place, and all the after actions of my life shall mark my penitence
and my bounty.
Heark!
[A Dialogue within sung in parts.
The sounds approach us.
1 D.
Where does proud Ambition dwell?
2.
In the lowest Rooms of Hell.
1.
[50] Of

the damn’d who leads the Host?

2.
He who did oppress the most.
1.
Who such Troops of damned brings?

26

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

2.
Most are led by fighting Kings.
Kings who did Crowns unjustly get,
Here on burning Thrones are set.

ANTONIO
[75] Sure Hell is open’d to devour us quick.

CHORUS
Kings who did Crowns, &c.

1ST DEVIL
Say Brother, shall we bear these mortals hence?

ANTONIO
Do you hear, Sir, how they lay our Crimes before us?

2ND DEVIL
First let us shew the shapes of their offence.

GONZALO
Do evil Spirits imitate the good,
In shewing men their sins?

1ST DEVIL
We’ll muster then their crimes on either side:
Appear! appear! their first begotten, Pride.

ALONZO
But in a different way,
Those warn from doing, these unbraid ’em done.
1.
Who are the Pillars of Ambitions Court?
2.
Grim Deaths and Scarlet Murthers it support.
1.
What lyes beneath her feet?
2.
Her footsteps tread,
On Orphans tender breasts, and Brothers dead.
1.
Can Heaven permit such Crimes should be
Rewarded with felicity?
2.
Oh no! uneasily their Crowns they wear,
And their own guilt amidst their Guards they fear.
Cares when they wake their minds unquiet keep,
And we in visions lord it o’re their sleep.

PRIDE
Lo! I am here, who led their hearts astray,
And to Ambition did their minds betray.

CHORUS
Oh no! uneasily their Crowns, &c.
ALONZO
See where they come in horrid shapes!
Enter the two that sung, in the shape of Devils,

27

placing themselves at two corners of the Stage.

FRAUD
And guileful Fraud does next appear,
Their wandring steps who led,
When they from virtue fled,
And in my crooked paths their course did steer.
RAPINE
From Fraud to Force they soon arrive,
Where Rapine did their actions drive.

[Enter Pride.

[Enter Fraud.

[Enter Rapine.

[Enter Murther.

MURDER
There long they cannot stay,
Down the deep precipice they run,
And to secure what they have done,
To murder bend their way.
After which they fall into a round encompassing
the Duke, &c. Singing.
Around, around, we pace
About this cursed place,
Whilst thus we compass in
These mortals and their sin.

[All the spirits vanish.
[Dance.

28

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest
Hark! hark! Bow-waugh; the watch-dogs bark,
Bow-waugh.

ANTONIO
Heav’n has heard me! they are vanish’d.

ARIEL
Hark! hark! I hear the strain of strutting Chanticleer
Cry Cock a doodle do.

ALONZO
But they have left me all unman’d;
I feel my sinews slacken’d with the fright,
And a cold sweat trills down o’re all my limbs,
[100] As if I were dissolving into Water.
O Prospero! my crimes ’gainst thee sit heavy on my heart.

FERDINAND
Where should this Musick be? i’th’ Air, orth’ Earth?
[125] It sounds no more, and sure it waits upon some God
O’th’ Island, sitting on a bank weeping against the Duke
My Father’s wrack. This musick hover’d o’re me
On the waters, allaying both their fury and my passion
With charming Airs; thence I have follow’d it (or it
Hath drawn me rather) but ’tis gone;
No, it begins again.

ANTONIO
And mine, ’gainst him and young Hippolito.
GONZALO
Heav’n have mercy on the penitent!
ALONZO
Lead from this cursed ground;
The Seas, in all their rage, are not so dreadful.
This is the Region of despair and death.

Ariel. Song.
Full Fathoms five thy Father lyes,
Of his bones is Coral made:
Those are Pearls that were his eyes,
Nothing of him that does fade,
But does suffer a Sea-change
Into something rich and strange:
Sea-Nymphs hourly ring his,
Heark now I hear’em, Ding dong Bell.

GONZALO
Shall we not seek some food?
ALONZO
Beware all fruit but what the birds have peid,
The shadows of the Trees are poisonous too;
A secret venom slides from every branch.
My conscience doth distract me, O my Son!
Why do I speak of eating or repose,
Before I know thy fortune?

29

[Exeunt.

FERDINAND
The mournful Ditty mentions my drown’d Father,
This is no mortal business, nor a sound which the
Earth owns: I hear it now before me,
However I will on and follow it.

[Burthen, Ding dong.

[Ex. Ferd. and Ariel.

Enter Ferdinand, and Ariel, invisible, playing and singing.
Enter Stephano, Mustacho, Ventoso.
Ariel’s Song.
Come unto these yellow sands
And then take hands.
Curtsy’d when you have and kiss’d,
The wild waves whist.
Foot it featly here and there, and sweet sprights bear
the Burthen.
[Burthen dispersedly

VENTOSO
The Runlet of Brandy was a loving Runlet, and floated after us out of pure
pity.
MUSTACHO
This kind Bottle, like an old acquaintance, swam after it.
And this Scollop-shell is all our Plate now.

30

Dryden and Davenant

VENTOSO
’Tis well we have found something since we landed.
I prethee fill a soop, and let it go round.
[150] Where hast thou laid the Runlet?
MUSTACHO
I’th’ hollow of an old Tree.
VENTOSO
Fill apace,
We cannot live long in this barren Island, and we may
Take a soop before death, as well as others drink
At our Funerals.

The Tempest

31

VENTOSO
Beshrew thy heart for putting me in mind of thy Wife,
I had not thought of mine else, Nature will shew it self,
I must melt. I prithee fill agen, my Wife’s a good old jade,
And has but one eye left: but she’ll weep out that too,
When she hears that I am dead.
STEPHANO
ould you were both hang’d for putting in thought of [175] mine. But well, If
I return not in seven years to my own Country, she may marry agen: and ’tis
from this Island thither at least seven years swimming.
MUSTACHO
O at least, having no help of Boat nor Bladders.

MUSTACHO
This is prize-Brandy, we steal Custom, and it costs nothing. Let’s have two
rounds more.

STEPHANO
Whoe’re she marries, poor soul, she’ll weep a nights when she thinks of
Stephano.

VENTOSO
Master, what have you sav’d?

VENTOSO
But Master, sorrow is dry! there’s for you agen.

STEPHANO
Just nothing but my self.

STEPHANO
A Mariner had e’en as good be as Fish as a Man, but for the comfort we get
ashore: O for any old dry Wench now I am wet.

VENTOSO
This works comfortably on a cold stomach.
STEPHANO
Fill’s another round.
VENTOSO
Look! Mustacho weeps. Hang losses as long as we have Brandy left. Prithee
leave weeping.
STEPHANO
He sheds his Brandy out of his eyes: he shall drink no more.
MUSTACHO
This will be a doleful day with old Bess. She gave me a gilt Nutmeg at
parting. That’s lost too. But as you say, hang losses. Prithee fill agen.

MUSTACHO
Poor heart! that would soon make you dry agen: but all is barren in this
Isle: here we may lye at Hull till the Wind blow Nore and by South, e’re we
can cry a Sail, a Sail at sight of a white Apron. And therefore here’s another
soop to comfort us.
VENTOSO
This Isle’s our own, that’s our comfort, for the Duke, the Prince, and all
their train are perished.
MUSTACHO
Our Ship is sunk, and we can never get home agen: we must e’en turn
Salvages, and the next that catches his fellow may eat him.
VENTOSO
No, no, let us have a Government; for if we live well and orderly, Heav’n will
drive the Shipwracks ashore to make us all rich, therefore let us carry good

32

Dryden and Davenant

Consciences, and not eat one another.
STEPHANO
Whoever eats any of my subjects, I’le break out his [200] Teeth with my
Scepter: for I was Master at Sea, and will be Duke on Land: you Mustacho
have been my Mate, and shall be my Vice-Roy.
VENTOSO
When you are Duke you may chuse your Vice-Roy; but I am a free Subject
in a new Plantation, and will have no Duke without my voice. And so fill me
the other soop.
STEPHANO WHISPERING
Ventoso, dost thou hear, I will advance thee, prithee give me thy voice.

The Tempest

33

Enter Trincalo with a great bottle, half drunk.
VENTOSO
How! Trincalo our brave Bosen!
MUSTACHO
He reels: can he be drunk with Sea-water?
TRINCALO SINGS.
I shall no more to Sea, to Sea,
Here I shall dye ashore.
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man’s funeral,
But here’s my comfort.

[Drinks.

Sings.
VENTOSO
I’le have no whisperings to corrupt the Election; and to show that I have no
private ends, I declare aloud that I will be Vice-Roy, or I’le keep my voice
for my self.
MUSTACHO
Stephano, hear me, I will speak for the people, because there are few, or
rather none in the Isle to speak for themselves. Know then, that to prevent
the farther shedding of Christian blood, we are all content Ventoso shall be
Vice-Roy, upon condition I may be Vice-Roy over him. Speak good people,
are you well agreed? what, no man answer? well, you may take their silence
for consent.
VENTOSO
You speak for the people, Mustacho? I’le speak for ’em, and declare
generally with one voice, one word and all; that there shall be no Vice-Roy
but the Duke, unless I be he.
MUSTACHO
You declare for the people, who never saw your face! Cold Iron shall decide
it.
[Both draw.
STEPHANO
Hold, loving Subjects: we will have no Civil war during our Reign: I do
hereby appoint you both to be my Vice-Roys [225] over the whole Island.
BOTH
Agreed! agreed!

The Master, the Swabber, the Gunner, and I,
The Surgeon, and his Mate,
Lov’d Mall, Meg, and Marrian, and Margery,
But none of us car’d for Kate.
For she had a tongue with a tang,
Wou’d cry to a Saylor, go hang:
She lov’d not the savour of Tar nor of Pitch,
Yet a Taylor might scratch her where e’re she did itch.
This is a scurvy Tune too, but here’s my comfort agen.
STEPHANO
We have got another subject now; welcome,
Welcome into our Dominions!
TRINCALO
What Subject, or what Dominions? here’s old Sack
Boys: the King of good fellows can be no subject.
I will be Old Simon the King.
MUSTACHO
Hah, old Boy! how didst thou scape?
TRINCALO
Upon a Butt of Sack, Boys, which the Saylors
Threw overboard: but are you alive, hoa! for I will
[250] Tipple with no Ghosts till I’m dead: thy hand Mustacho,
And thine Ventoso; the storm has done its worst:

[Drinks.

34

Dryden and Davenant

Stephano alive too! give thy Bosen thy hand, Master.
VENTOSO
You must kiss it then, for, I must tell you, we have chosen him Duke in a full
Assembly.
TRINCALO
A Duke! where? what’s he Duke of?
MUSTACHO
Of this Island, man. Oh Trincalo we are all made, the
Island’s empty; all’s our own, Boy; and we will speak to his
Grace for thee, that thou may’st be as great as we are.
TRINCALO
You great? what the Devil are you?
VENTOSO
We two are Vice-Roys over all the Island; and when we are weary of
Governing thou shalt succeed us.
TRINCALO
Do you hear, Ventoso, I will succeed you in both your places before you
enter into ’em.
STEPHANO
Trincalo, sleep and be sober; and make no more uproars in my Country.
TRINCALO
Why, what are you, Sir, what are you?
STEPHANO
What I am, I am by free election, and you Trincalo are not your self; but we
pardon your first fault,
Because it is the first day of our Reign.
TRINCALO
Umph, were matters carried so swimmingly against me, whilst I was
swimming, and saving my self for the good of the people of this Island.
MUSTACHO
Art thou mad Trincalo, wilt thou disturb a settled Government?

The Tempest

35

TRINCALO
I say this Island shall be under Trincalo, or it shall be [275] a Commonwealth; and so my Bottle is my Buckler, and so I draw my Sword.
[Draws.
VENTOSO
Ah Trincalo, I thought thou hadst had more grace,
Than to rebel against thy old Master,
And thy two lawful Vice-Roys.
MUSTACHO
Wilt not thou take advice of two that stand
For old Counsellors here, where thou art a meer stranger
To the Laws of the Country.
TRINCALO
I’ll have no Laws.
VENTOSO
Then Civil-War begins.

[Vent. Must. draw.

STEPHANO
Hold, hold, I’le have no blood shed,
My Subjects are but few: let him make a rebellion
By himself; and a Rebel, I Duke Stephano declare him:
Vice-Roys, come away.
TRINCALO
And Duke Trincalo declares, that he will make open war wherever he meets
thee or thy Vice-Roys.
[Ex. Steph. Must. Vent.
Enter Caliban with wood upon his back.
TRINCALO
Hah! who have we here?
CALIBAN
All the infections that the Sun sucks up from Fogs, Fens, Flats, on Prospero
fall; and make him by inch-meal a Disease: his spirits hear me, and yet I
needs must curse, but they’l not pinch, fright me with Urchin shows, pitch
me i’th’ mire, nor lead me in the dark out of my way, unless he bid ’em: but
for every trifle he sets them on me; sometimes like Baboons they mow and
chatter at me, and often bite me; like Hedge-hogs then they mount their

36

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

prickles at me, tumbling before me in my [300] barefoot way. Sometimes I
am all wound about with Adders, who with their cloven tongues hiss me to
madness. Hah! yonder stands one of his spirits sent to torment me.

CALIBAN
I’le shew thee every fertile inch i’th’ Isle, and kiss thy foot: I prithee be my
God, and let me drink.
[Drinks agen.

TRINCALO
What have we here, a man, or a fish?
This is some Monster of the Isle, were I in England,
As once I was, and had him painted;
Not a Holy-day fool there but would give me
Six-pence for the sight of him; well, if I could make
Him tame, he were a present for an Emperour.
Come hither pretty Monster, I’le do thee no harm.
Come hither!
CALIBAN
Torment me not;
I’le bring thee Wood home faster.
TRINCALO
He talks none of the wisest, but I’le give him
A dram o’th’ Bottle, that will clear his understanding.
Come on your ways Master Monster, open your mouth.
How now, you perverse Moon-calf! what,
I think you cannot tell who is your friend!
Open your chops, I say.
[Pours Wine down his throat.
CALIBAN
This is a brave God, and bears coelestial Liquor,
I’le kneel to him.
TRINCALO
He is a very hopeful Monster; Monster what say’st thou, art thou content
to turn civil and sober, as I am? for then thou shalt be my subject.
CALIBAN
I’le swear upon that Bottle to be true; for the liquor [325] is not Earthly:
did’st thou not drop from Heaven?
TRINCALO
Only out of the Moon, I was the man in her when time was. By this light, a
very shallow Monster.

TRINCALO
Well drawn, Monster, in good faith.
CALIBAN
I’le shew thee the best Springs, I’le pluck thee Berries,
I’le fish for thee, and get thee wood enough:
A curse upon the Tyrant whom I serve, I’le bear him
No more sticks, but follow thee.
TRINCALO
The poor Monster is loving in his drink.
CALIBAN
I prithee let me bring thee where Crabs grow,
And I with my long Nails, will dig thee Pig-nuts,
Shew thee a Jay’s Nest, and instruct thee how to snare
The Marmazet; I’le bring thee to cluster’d Filberds;
Wilt thou go with me?
TRINCALO
This Monster comes of a good natur’d race;
Is there no more of thy kin in this Island?
CALIBAN
Divine, here is but one besides my self;
My lovely Sister, beautiful and bright as the full Moon.
TRINCALO
Where is she?
CALIBAN
I left her clambring up a hollow Oak,
And plucking thence the dropping Honey-Combs.
Say my King, shall I call her to thee?
TRINCALO
She shall swear upon the Bottle too.
[350] If she proves handsom she is mine: here Monster,
Drink agen for thy good news; thou shalt speak

37

38

Dryden and Davenant

A good word for me.

The Tempest
[Gives him the Bottle.

CALIBAN SINGS.
Farewel, old Master, farewel, farewel.
No more Dams I’le make for Fish,
Nor fetch in firing at requiring,
Nor scrape Trencher, nor wash Dish,
Ban, Ban, Cackaliban
Has a new Master, get a new man.
Heigh-day, Freedom, freedom!
TRINCALO
Here’s two subjects got already, the Monster,
And his Sister: well, Duke Stephano, I say, and say agen,
Wars will ensue, and so I drink.
From this worshipful Monster, and Mistress,
Monster his Sister,
I’le lay claim to this Island by Alliance:
Monster, I say thy Sister shall be my Spouse:
Come away Brother Monster, I’le lead thee to my Butt
And drink her health.

HIPPOLITO
Since I knew life, you’ve kept me in a Rock,
And you this day have hurry’d me from thence,
Only to change my Prison, not to free me.
I murmur not, but I may wonder at it.
PROSPERO
O gentle Youth, Fate waits for thee abroad,
A black Star threatens thee, and death unseen
Stands ready to devour thee.
HIPPOLITO
You taught me not to fear him in any of his shapes:
Let me meet death rather than be a Prisoner.

[Drinks.
PROSPERO
’Tis pity he should seize thy tender youth.

[Exeunt.

HIPPOLITO
Sir, I have often heard you say, no creature liv’d
Within this Isle, but those which Man was Lord of,
Why then should I fear?

Enter Prospero alone.
PROSPERO
’Tis not yet fit to let my Daughters know I kept
The infant Duke of Mantua so near them in this Isle,
Whose Father dying bequeath’d him to my care,
Till my false Brother (when he design’d t’usurp
My Dukedom from me) expos’d him to that fate
He meant for me. By calculation of his birth
[375] I saw death threat’ning him, if, till some time were
Past, he should behold the face of any Woman:
And now the danger’s nigh: Hippolito!
[Enter Hippolito.
HIPPOLITO
Sir, I attend your pleasure.
PROSPERO
How I have lov’d thee from thy infancy,
Heav’n knows, and thou thy self canst bear me witness,
Therefore accuse not me for thy restraint.

PROSPERO
But here are creatures which I nam’d not to thee,
Who share man’s soveraignty by Nature’s Laws,
And oft depose him from it.
HIPPOLITO
What are those Creatures, Sir?
PROSPERO
Those dangerous enemies of men call’d women.
HIPPOLITO
[400] Women! I never heard of them before.
But have I Enemies within this Isle, and do you
Keep me from them? do you think that I want
Courage to encounter ’em?
PROSPERO
No courage can resist ’em.

39

40

Dryden and Davenant

HIPPOLITO
How then have you, Sir,
Liv’d so long unharm’d among them?
PROSPERO
O they despise old age, and spare it for that reason:
It is below their conquest, their fury falls
Alone upon the young.
HIPPOLITO
Why then the fury of the young should fall on them again.
Pray turn me loose upon ’em: but, good Sir,
What are women like?
PROSPERO
Imagine something between young men and Angels:
Fatally beauteous, and have killing Eyes,
Their voices charm beyond the Nightingales,
They are all enchantment, those who once behold ’em,
Are made their slaves for ever.
HIPPOLITO
Then I will wink and fight with ’em.
PROSPERO
’Tis but in vain, for when your eyes are shut,
They through the lids will shine, and pierce your soul;
Absent, they will be present to you.
They’l haunt you in your very sleep.
HIPPOLITO
Then I’le revenge it on ’em when I wake.
PROSPERO
You are without all possibility of revenge,
[425] They are so beautiful that you can ne’re attempt,
Nor wish to hurt them.
HIPPOLITO
Are they so beautiful?
PROSPERO
Calm sleep is not so soft, nor Winter Suns,

The Tempest

41

Nor Summer Shades so pleasant.
HIPPOLITO
Can they be fairer than the Plumes of Swans?
Or more delightful than the Peacocks Feathers?
Or than the gloss upon the necks of Doves?
Or have more various beauty than the Rain-bow?
These I have seen, and without danger wondred at.
PROSPERO
All these are far below ’em. Nature made
Nothing but Woman dangerous and fair:
Therefore if you should chance to see ’em,
Avoid ’em streight, I charge you.
HIPPOLITO
Well, since you say they are so dangerous,
I’le so far shun ’em as I may with safety of the
Unblemish’d honour which you taught me.
But let ’em not provoke me, for I’m sure I shall
Not then forbear them.
PROSPERO
Go in and read the Book I gave you last.
Tomorrow I may bring you better news.
HIPPOLITO
shall obey you, Sir.

[Exit Hippolito.

PROSPERO
So, so; I hope this lesson has secur’d him,
For I have been constrain’d to change his Lodging
From yonder Rock where first I bred him up,
[450] And here have brought him home to my own Cell,
Because the Shipwrack happen’d near his Mansion.
I hope he will not stir beyond his limits,
For hither he hath been all obedience;
The Planets seem to smile on my designs,
And yet there is one sullen cloud behind,
I would it were disperst.
[Enter Miranda and Dorinda.
How, my daughters! I thought I had instructed
Them enough: Children! retire;
Why do you walk this way?

42

Dryden and Davenant

MIRANDA
It is within our bounds, Sir.
PROSPERO
But both take heed, that path is very dangerous.
Remember what I told you.
DORINDA
Is the man that way, Sir?
PROSPERO
All that you can imagine is ill there,
The curled Lyon, and the rugged Bear
Are not so dreadful as that man.
MIRANDA
Oh me, why stay we here then?
DORINDA
I’le keep far enough from his Den, I warrant him.
MIRANDA
But you have told me, Sir, you are a man;
And yet you are not dreadful.
PROSPERO
I child! but I am a tame man; old men are tame
By Nature, but all the danger lies in a wild
Young man.
DORINDA
Do they run wild about the Woods?
PROSPERO
[475] No, they are wild within Doors, in Chambers,
And in Closets.
DORINDA
But Father, I would stroak ’em and make ’em gentle,
Then sure they would not hurt me.

The Tempest
PROSPERO
You must not trust them, Child: no woman can come
Neer ’em but she feels a painfull nine Months:
Well I must in; for new affairs require my
Presence: be you, Miranda, your Sister’s Guardian.
DORINDA
Come, Sister, shall we walk the other way,
The man will catch us else, we have but two legs,
And he perhaps has four.
MIRANDA
Well, Sister, though he have; yet look about you
And we shall spy him e’re he comes too near us.
DORINDA
Come back, that way is towards his Den.
MIRANDA
Let me alone; I’le venture first, for sure he can
Devour but one of us at once.
DORINDA
How dare you venture?
MIRANDA
We’ll find him sitting like a Hare in’s Form,
And he shall not see us.
DORINDA
I, but you know my Father charg’d us both.
MIRANDA
But who shall tell him on’t? we’ll keep each
Others Counsel.
DORINDA
I dare not for the world.
MIRANDA
But how shall we hereafter shun him, if we do not
Know him first?

43

[Exit Prospero.

44

Dryden and Davenant

DORINDA
[500] Nay I confess I would fain see him too. I find it in my Nature, because
my Father has forbidden me.
MIRANDA
I, there’s it, Sister, if he had said nothing I had been quiet. Go softly, and if
you see him first, be quick and becken me away.
DORINDA
Well, if he does catch me, I’le humble my self to him,
And ask him pardon, as I do my Father,
When I have done a fault.
MIRANDA
And if I can but scape with life, I had rather be in pain nine Months, as my
Father threatn’d, than lose my longing.
[Exeunt.
The Scene changes, and discovers Hippolito
in a Cave walking, his face from the Audience.
HIPPOLITO
Prospero has often said that Nature makes
Nothing in vain: why then are women made?
Are they to suck the poyson of the Earth,
As gaudy colour’d Serpents are? I’le ask that
Question, when next I see him here.

The Tempest

MIRANDA
Heaven! what a goodly thing it is?
DORINDA
I’le go nearer it.
MIRANDA
O no, ’tis dangerous, Sister! I’le go to it.
[525] I would not for the world that you should venture.
My Father charg’d me to secure you from it.
DORINDA
I warrant you this is a tame man, dear Sister,
He’ll not hurt me, I see it by his looks.
MIRANDA
Indeed he will! but go back, and he shall eat me first:
Fye, are you not asham’d to be so much inquisitive?
DORINDA
You chide me for’t, and wou’d give yourself.
MIRANDA
Come back, or I will tell my Father.
Observe how he begins to stare already.
I’le meet the danger first, and then call you.

Enter Miranda and Dorinda peeping.
DORINDA
Sister, there it is, it walks about like one of us.

DORINDA
Nay, Sister, you shall never vanquish me in kindness.
I’le venture you, no more than you will me.

MIRANDA
I, just so, and has legs as we have too.

PROSPERO WITHIN
iranda, Child, where are you!

HIPPOLITO
It strangely puzzles me: yet ’tis most likely
Women are somewhat between men and spirits.

MIRANDA
Do you not hear my Father call? go in.

DORINDA
Heark! it talks, sure this is not it my Father meant,
For this is just like one of us: methinks I am not half
So much afraid on’t as I was; see, now it turns this way.

DORINDA
’Twas you he nam’d, not me; I will but say my Prayers,
And follow you immediately.

45

46

Dryden and Davenant

MIRANDA
Well, Sister, you’l repent it.

The Tempest

[Exit Miranda.

DORINDA
Though I dye for’t, I must have th’other peep.

I’ve seen two Serpents harmless to each other,
Though they have twin’d into a mutual Knot:
If we have any venome in us, sure, we cannot be more
Poysonous, when we meet, than Serpents are.
You have a hand like mine, may I not gently touch it?

47

[Takes her hand.

HIPPOLITO SEEING HER
What thing is that? sure ’tis some Infant of the Sun, dress’d in his Fathers
gayest Beams, and comes to play with Birds: my sight is dazl’d, and yet I
find I’m loth to shut my Eyes.
I must go nearer it—but stay a while;
May it not be that beauteous murderer, Woman,
Which I was charg’d to shun? Speak, what art thou?
[550] Thou shining Vision!

DORINDA
I’ve touch’d my Father’s and my Sister’s hands
[575] And felt no pain; but now, alas! there’s something,
When I touch yours, which makes me sigh: just so
I’ve seen two Turtles mourning when they met;
Yet mine’s a pleasing grief; and so methought was theirs;
For still they mourn’d, and still they seem’d to murmur too,
And yet they often met.

DORINDA
Alas I know not; but I’m told I am a Woman;
Do not hurt me, pray, fair thing.

HIPPOLITO
Oh Heavens! I have the same sense too: your hand
Methinks goes through me; I feel at my heart,
And find it pleases, though it pains me.

HIPPOLITO
I’d sooner tear my eyes out, than consent to do you any harm; though I was
told a Woman was my Enemy.
DORINDA
I never knew what ’twas to be an Enemy, nor can I e’re prove so to that
which looks like you: for though I have been charg’d by him (whom yet I
never disobey’d) to shun your presence, yet I’d rather dye than lose it;
therefore I hope you will not have the heart to hurt me: though I fear you
are a man, that dangerous thing of which I have been warn’d; pray tell me
what you are?
HIPPOLITO
I must confess, I was inform’d I am a man,
But if I fright you, I shall wish I were some other Creature.
I was bid to fear you too.
DORINDA
y me! Heav’n grant we be not poyson to each other!
Alas, can we not meet but we must die?
HIPPOLITO
I hope not so! for when two poysonous Creatures,
Both of the same kind, meet, yet neither dies.

PROSPERO WITHIN
Dorinda!
DORINDA
My Father calls agen, ah, I must leave you.
HIPPOLITO
Alas, I’m subject to the same command.
DORINDA
This is my first offence against my Father,
Which he, by severing us, too cruelly does punish.
HIPPOLITO
And this is my first trespass too: but he hath more
Offended truth than we have him:
He said our meeting would destructive be,
But I no death but in our parting see.
[Exeunt several ways.

48

Dryden and Davenant

ACT III.
Enter Prospero and Miranda.
PROSPERO
EXCUSE it not, Miranda, for to you (the elder, and, I thought the more
discreet) I gave the conduct of your Sister’s actions.
MIRANDA
Sir, when you call’d me thence, I did not fail to mind her of her duty to
depart.
PROSPERO
How can I think you did remember hers, when you forgot your own? did
you not see the man whom I commanded you to shun?
MIRANDA
I must confess I saw him at a distance.
PROSPERO
Did not his Eyes infect and poyson you?
What alteration found you in your self?
MIRANDA
I only wondred at a sight so new.
PROSPERO
But have you no desire once more to see him?
Come, tell me truly what you think of him?
MIRANDA
As of the gayest thing I ever saw, so fine that it appear’d more fit to be
belov’d than fear’d, and seem’d so near my kind, that I did think I might
have call’d it Sister.
PROSPERO
You do not love it?
MIRANDA
How is it likely that I should, except the thing had first lov’d me?

The Tempest

49

PROSPERO
Cherish those thoughts: you have a gen’rous soul;
And since I see your mind not apt to take the light
Impressions of a sudden love, I will unfold
A secret to your knowledge.
[25] That Creature which you saw, is of a kind which
Nature made a prop and guide to yours.
MIRANDA
Why did you then propose him as an object of terrour to my mind? you
never us’d to teach me any thing but God-like truths, and what you said I
did believe as sacred.
PROSPERO
I fear’d the pleasing form of this young man
Might unawares possess your tender breast,
Which for a nobler Guest I had design’d;
For shortly, my Miranda, you shall see another of his kind,
The full blown-flower, of which this youth was but the
Op’ning-bud. Go in, and send your sister to me.
MIRANDA
Heav’n still preserve you, Sir.

[Ex. Miranda.

PROSPERO
And make thee fortunate.
Dorinda now must be examin’d too concerning this
Late interview. I’m sure unartful truth lies open
In her mind, as Crystal streams their sandy bottom show.
I must take care her love grow not too fast,
For innocence is Love’s most fertile soil,
Wherein he soon shoots up and widely spreads,
Nor is that danger which attends Hippolito yet overpast.
[Enter Dorinda.
PROSPERO
O, come hither, you have seen a man to day,
Against my strict command.
DORINDA
Who I? indeed I saw him but a little, Sir.

50

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
Come, come, be clear. Your Sister told me all.
DORINDA
Did she? truly she would have seen him more than I,
[50] But that I would not let her.
PROSPERO
Why so?
DORINDA
Because, methought, he would have hurt me less
Than he would her. But if I knew you’d not be angry
With him, I could tell you, Sir, that he was much to blame.
PROSPERO
Hah! was he to blame? Tell me, with that sincerity I taught you, how you
became so bold to see the man?
DORINDA
I hope you will forgive me, Sir, because I did not see him much till he saw
me. Sir, he would needs come in my way, and star’d, and star’d upon my
face; and so I thought I would be reveng’d of him, and therefore I gaz’d on
him as long; but if I e’re come neer a man again—
PROSPERO
I told you he was dangerous; but you would not be warn’d.
DORINDA
Pray be not angry, Sir, if I tell you, you are mistaken in him; for he did me
no great hurt.

The Tempest
DORINDA
Nay pray, Sir, say not so, I promis’d him
To see him once agen; and you know, Sir,
You charg’d me I should never break my promise.
PROSPERO
[75] Wou’d you see him who did you so much mischief?
DORINDA
I warrant you I did him as much harm as he did me,
For when I left him, Sir, he sigh’d so as it griev’d
My heart to hear him.
PROSPERO
Those sighs were poysonous, they infected you:
You say they griev’d you to the heart.
DORINDA
’Tis true; but yet his looks and words were gentle.
PROSPERO
These are the Day-dreams of a maid in love,
But still I fear the worst.
DORINDA
O fear not him, Sir,
I know he will not hurt you for my sake;
I’le undertake to tye him to a hair,
And lead him hither as my Pris’ner to you.

DORINDA
No, Sir, I’m as well as e’re I was in all my life,
But that I cannot eat nor drink for thought of him.
That dangerous man runs ever in my mind.

PROSPERO
Take heed, Dorinda, you may be deceiv’d;
This Creature is of such a Salvage race,
That no mild usage can reclaim his wildness;
But, like a Lyon’s whelp bred up by hand,
When least you look for’t, Nature will present
The Image of his Fathers bloody Paws,
Wherewith he purvey’d for his couching Queen;
And he will leap into his native fury.

PROSPERO
The way to cure you, is no more to see him.

DORINDA
He cannot change from what I left him, Sir.

PROSPERO
But he may do you more harm hereafter.

51

52

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
You speak of him with too much passion; tell me
(And on your duty tell me true, Dorinda)
What past betwixt you and that horrid creature?
DORINDA
[100] How, horrid, Sir? if any else but you should call it so, indeed I should
be angry.
PROSPERO
Go too! you are a foolish Girl; but answer to what I ask, what thought you
when you saw it?
DORINDA
t first it star’d upon me and seem’d wild,
And then I trembled, yet it look’d so lovely, that when
I would have fled away, my feet seem’d fasten’d to the ground,
Then it drew near, and with amazement askt
To touch my hand; which, as a ransom for my life,
I gave: but when he had it, with a furious gripe
He put it to his mouth so eagerly, I was afraid he
Would have swallow’d it.
PROSPERO
Well, what was his behaviour afterwards?
DORINDA
He on a sudden grew so tame and gentle,
That he became more kind to me than you are;
Then, Sir, I grew I know not how, and touching his hand
Agen, my heart did beat so strong as I lackt breath
To answer what he ask’d.

The Tempest
The Battels of thy Enemy, and ’tis one part of what
I threatn’d thee, not to perceive thy danger.
DORINDA
[125] Danger, Sir?
If he would hurt me, yet he knows not how:
He hath no Claws, nor Teeth, nor Horns to hurt me,
But looks about him like a Callow-bird
Just straggl’d from the Nest: pray trust me, Sir,
To go to him agen.
PROSPERO
Since you will venture,
I charge you bear your self reserv’dly to him,
Let him not dare to touch your naked hand,
But keep at distance from him.
DORINDA
This is hard.
PROSPERO
It is the way to make him love you more;
He will despise you if you grow too kind.
DORINDA
I’le struggle with my heart to follow this,
But if I lose him by it, will you promise
To bring him back agen?
PROSPERO
Fear not, Dorinda;
But use him ill and he’l be yours for ever.

PROSPERO
You have been too fond, and I should chide you for it.

DORINDA
I hope you have not couzen’d me agen.

DORINDA
Then send me to that creature to be punisht.

PROSPERO
Now my designs are gathering to a head.
My spirits are obedient to my charms.
What, Ariel! my servant Ariel, where art thou?

PROSPERO
Poor Child! thy passion like a lazy Ague
Has seiz’d thy blood, instead of striving thou humour’st
And feed’st thy languishing disease: thou fight’st

53

ARIEL
What wou’d my potent Master? here I am.

[Exit Dorinda.

[Enter Ariel.

54

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
Did worthily perform, and I must use you in such another
[150] Work: how goes the day?
ARIEL
On the fourth, my Lord, and on the sixth you said our work should cease.
PROSPERO
And so it shall;
And thou shalt have the open air at freedom.
ARIEL
Thanks my great Lord.
PROSPERO
But tell me first, my spirit,
How fares the Duke, my Brother, and their followers?
ARIEL
Confin’d together, as you gave me order,
In the Lime-Grove which weather-fends your Cell;
Within that Circuit up and down they wander,
But cannot stir one step beyond their compass.
PROSPERO
How do they bear their sorrows?
ARIEL
The two Dukes appear like men distracted, their
Attendants brim-full of sorrow mourning over ’em;
But chiefly, he you term’d the good Gonzalo:
His tears run down his Beard, like Winter-drops
From Eaves of Reeds, your Vision did so work ’em,
That if you now beheld ’em, your affections
Would become tender.
PROSPERO
Dost thou think so, Spirit?
ARIEL
Mine would, Sir, were I humane.

The Tempest

PROSPERO
And mine shall:
Hast thou, who art but air, a touch, a feeling of their
Afflictions, and shall not I (a man like them, one
[175] Who as sharply relish passions as they) be kindlier
Mov’d than thou art? though they have pierc’d
Me to the quick with injuries, yet with my nobler
Reason ’gainst my fury I will take part;
The rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance.
Go, my Ariel, refresh with needful food their
Famish’d bodies. With shows and cheerful
Musick comfort ’em.
ARIEL
Presently, Master.
PROSPERO
With a twinckle, Ariel.
ARIEL
Before you can say come and go,
And breath twice, and cry so; so,
Each spirit tripping on his toe,
Shall bring ’em meat with mop and moe,
Do you love me, Master, I, or no?
PROSPERO
Dearly, my dainty Ariel, but stay, spirit;
What is become of my Slave Caliban,
And Sycorax his Sister?
ARIEL
Potent Sir!
They have cast off your service, and revolted
To the wrack’d Mariners, who have already
Parcell’d your Island into Governments.
PROSPERO
No matter, I have now no need of ’em;
But, spirit, now I stay thee on the Wing;
Haste to perform what I have given in charge:
[200] But see they keep within the bounds I set ’em.

55

56

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

57

And calm your troubled thoughts.
ARIEL
I’le keep ’em in with Walls of Adamant,
Invisible as air to mortal Eyes,
But yet unpassable.
PROSPERO
Make hast then.

Ariel invisible Sings.

[Exeunt severally.
Enter Alonzo, Antonio, Gonzalo.

GONZALO
I am weary, and can go no further, Sir,
My old Bones ake, here’s a Maze trod indeed
Through forth-rights and Meanders, by your patience
I needs must rest.
ALONZO
Old Lord, I cannot blame thee, who am my self seiz’d
With a weariness to the dulling of my Spirits:
Sit and rest.
Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it no longer
For my Flatterers: he is drown’d whom thus we
Stray to find, and the Sea mocks our frustrate
Search on Land: well! let him go.

ALONZO
This voice speaks comfort to us.
ANTONIO
Wou’d ’twere come; there is no Musick in a Song
To me, my stomack being empty.
[They sit.

GONZALO
O for a heavenly Vision of Boyl’d,
Bak’d, and Roasted!
Enter eight fat Spirits, with Cornu-Copia in their hands.

ANTONIO
Do not for one repulse forego the purpose
Which you resolv’d t’effect.
ALONZO
I’m faint with hunger, and must despair
Of food, Heav’n hath incens’d the Seas and
Shores against us for our crimes.
What! Harmony agen, my good friends, heark!

Dry those eyes which are o’reflowing,
All your storms are over-blowing:
While you in this Isle are bideing,
You shall feast without providing:
Every dainty you can think of,
Ev’ry Wine which you would drink of,
Shall be yours; all want shall shun you,
Ceres blessing so is on you.

ALONZO
Are these plump shapes sent to deride our hunger?

[Musick.

GONZALO
No, no: it is a Masque of fatten’d Devils, the
Burgo-Masters of the lower Region.
O for a Collop of that large-haunch’d Devil
Who went out last!

ANTONIO
I fear some other horrid apparition.
Give us kind Keepers, Heaven I beseech thee!

ANTONIO GOING TO THE DOOR
My Lord, the Duke, see yonder.
A Table, as I live, set out and furnisht
With all varieties of Meats and fruits.

GONZALO
’Tis chearful Musick, this, unlike the first;
[225] And seems as ’twere meant t’unbend our cares,

ALONZO
’Tis so indeed, but who dares tast this feast,
Which Fiends provide, perhaps, to poyson us?

[Dance and vanish.

58

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

GONZALO
[250] Why that dare I; if the black Gentleman be so ill-natur’d, he may do his
pleasure.
ANTONIO
’Tis certain we must either eat or famish,
I will encounter it, and feed.

SYCORAX
No, my dread Lord.
TRINCALO
It shall be a Whistle for our first Babe, and when the next Shipwrack puts
me again to swimming, I’le dive to get a [275] Coral to it.
SYCORAX
I’le be thy pretty child, and wear it first.

ALONZO
If both resolve, I will adventure too.
GONZALO
Then good my Lord, make haste,
And say no Grace before it, I beseech you,
Because the meat will vanish strait, if, as I fear,
An evil Spirit be our Cook.

59

TRINCALO
I prithee sweet Babby do not play the wanton, and cry for my goods e’re I’m
dead. When thou art my Widow, thou shalt have the Devil and all.
SYCORAX
May I not have the other fine thing?
[Exeunt.

Enter Trincalo and Caliban.

TRINCALO
This is a sucking-Bottle for young Trincalo.

TRINCALO
Brother Monster, welcome to my private Palace.
But where’s thy Sister, is she so brave a Lass?

CALIBAN
This is a God a mighty liquor, I did but drink thrice of it, and it hath made
me glad e’re since.

CALIBAN
In all this Isle there are but two more, the Daughters of the Tyrant
Prospero; and she is bigger than ’em both. O here she comes; now thou
may’st judge thy self, my Lord.
[Enter Sycorax.

SYCORAX
He is the bravest God I ever saw.

TRINCALO
She’s monstrous fair indeed. Is this to be my Spouse? well she’s Heir of all
this Isle (for I will geld Monster). The Trincalos, like other wise men, have
anciently us’d to marry for Estate more than for beauty.
SYCORAX
I prithee let me have the gay thing about thy neck, and that which dangles
at thy wrist.
[Sycorax points to his Bosens Whistle, and his Bottle.
TRINCALO
My dear Blobber-lips; this, observe my Chuck, is a badge of my Sea-Office;
my fair Fuss, thou dost not know it.

CALIBAN
You must be kind to him, and he will love you.
I prithee speak to her, my Lord, and come neerer her.
TRINCALO
By this light, I dare not till I have drank: I must
Fortifie my stomack first.
SYCORAX
I shall have all his fine things when I’m a Widow.
[Pointing to his Bottle, and Bosens Whistle.
CALIBAN
I, but you must be kind and kiss him then.

60

Dryden and Davenant

TRINCALO
My Brother Monster is a rare Pimp.
SYCORAX
I’le hug thee in my arms, my Brother’s God.
TRINCALO
Think o’thy soul Trincalo, thou art a dead man if this kindness continue.
CALIBAN
And he shall get thee a young Sycorax, wilt thou not, my Lord?
TRINCALO
Indeed I know not how, they do no such thing in my Country.
SYCORAX
I’le shew thee how: thou shalt get me twenty Sycoraxes; [300] and I’le get
thee twenty Calibans.
TRINCALO
Nay, if they are got, she must do’t all her self, that’s certain.
SYCORAX
And we will tumble in cool Plashes, and the soft Fens, Where we will make
us Pillows of Flags and Bull-rushes.
CALIBAN
My Lord, she would be loving to thee, and thou wilt not let her.
TRINCALO
Ev’ry thing in its season, Brother Monster; but you must counsel her; fair
Maids must not be too forward.
SYCORAX
My Brother’s God, I love thee; prithee let me come to thee.
TRINCALO
Subject Monster, I charge thee keep the Peace between us.
CALIBAN
Shall she not taste of that immortal Liquor?

The Tempest

61

TRINCALO
Umph! that’s another question: for if she be thus flipant in her Water, what
will she be in her Wine? [Enter Ariel (invisible) and changes the Bottle
which stands upon the ground.
ARIEL
There’s Water for your Wine.
TRINCALO
Well! since it must be so.
How do you like it now, my Queen that
Must be?

[Exit Ariel.

[Gives her the Bottle.
[She drinks.

SYCORAX
Is this your heavenly liquor? I’le bring you to a River of the same.
TRINCALO
Wilt thou so, Madam Monster? what a mighty Prince shall I be then? I
would not change my Dukedom to be great Turk Trincalo.
SYCORAX
[325] This is the drink of Frogs.
TRINCALO
Nay, if the Frogs of this Island drink such, they are the merryest Frogs in
Christendom.
CALIBAN
She does not know the virtue of this liquor:
I prithee let me drink for her.
TRINCALO
Well said, Subject Monster.
CALIBAN
My Lord, this is meer water.
TRINCALO
’Tis thou hast chang’d the Wine then, and drunk it up,
Like a debauch’d Fish as thou art. Let me see’t,
I’le taste it my self. Element! meer Element! as I live.
It was a cold gulp such as this which kill’d my famous
Predecessor old Simon the King.

[Caliban drinks.

62

Dryden and Davenant

CALIBAN
How does thy honour? prithee be not angry, and I will lick thy shoe.
TRINCALO
I could find in my heart to turn thee out of my Dominions for a liquorish
Monster.
CALIBAN
O my Lord, I have found it out; this must be done by one of Prospero’s
spirits.
TRINCALO
There’s nothing but malice in these Devils, I never lov’d ’em from my
Childhood. The Devil take ’em, I would it had bin holy-water for their sakes.
SYCORAX
Will not thy mightiness revenge our wrongs, on this great Sorcerer? I know
thou wilt, for thou art valiant.
TRINCALO
In my Sack, Madam Monster, as any flesh alive.
SYCORAX
hen I will cleave to thee.
TRINCALO
[350] Lovingly said, in troth: now cannot I hold out against her. This Wifelike virtue of hers, has overcome me.
SYCORAX
Shall I have thee in my arms?
TRINCALO
Thou shalt have Duke Trincalo in thy arms:
But prithee be not too boistrous with me at first;
Do not discourage a young beginner.
[They embrace.
Stand to your Arms, my Spouse,
And subject Monster;
[Ent. Steph. Must. Vent.
The Enemy is come to surprise us in our Quarters.
You shall know Rebels that I’m marry’d to a Witch,
And we have a thousand Spirits of our party.

The Tempest

63

STEPHANO
Hold! I ask a Truce; I and my Vice-Roys
(Finding no food, and but a small remainder of Brandy)
Are come to treat a peace betwixt us,
Which may be for the good of both Armies,
Therefore Trincalo disband.
TRINCALO
Plain Trincalo, methinks I might have been a Duke in your mouth, I’le not
accept of your Embassy without my title.
STEPHANO
A title shall break no squares betwixt us:
Vice-Roys, give him his stile of Duke, and treat with him,
Whilst I walk by in state.
[Ventoso and Mustacho bow whilst
Trincalo puts on his Cap.
MUSTACHO
Our Lord and Master, Duke Stephano, has sent us
In the first place to demand of you, upon what
Ground you make war against him, having no right
[375] To Govern here, as being elected only by
Your own voice.
TRINCALO
To this I answer, that having in the face of the world
Espous’d the lawful Inheritrix of this Island,
Queen Blouze the first, and having homage done me,
By this hectoring Spark her Brother, from these two
I claim a lawful Title to this Island.
MUSTACHO
Who, that Monster? he a Hector?
CALIBAN
Lo! how he mocks me, wilt thou let him, my Lord?
VENTOSO
Lord! quoth he: the Monster’s a very natural.
SYCORAX
Lo! lo! agen; bite him to death I prithee.

64

Dryden and Davenant

TRINCALO
Vice-Roys keep good tongues in your heads
I advise you, and proceed to your business, for I have
Other affairs to dispatch of more importance betwixt
Queen Slobber-Chops and my self.
MUSTACHO
First and foremost, as to your claim that you have answer’d.
VENTOSO
But second and foremost, we demand of you,
That if we make a peace, the Butt also may be
Comprehended in the Treaty.

The Tempest

TRINCALO
Subject Monster! stand your Sentry before my Cellar; my Queen and I will
enter and feast our selves within.
SYCORAX
May I not marry that other King and his two subjects, to help you anights?
TRINCALO
What a careful Spouse have I? well! if she does
Cornute me, the care is taken.
When underneath my power my foes have truckl’d,
To be a Prince, who would not be a Cuckold?
Enter Ferdinand, and Ariel (invisible.)

MUSTACHO
Is the Butt safe, Duke Trincalo?
TRINCALO
The Butt is partly safe: but to comprehend it in the Treaty, or indeed to
make any Treaty, I cannot with my honour without your submission. These
two, and the Spirits under me, stand likewise upon their honours.
CALIBAN
Keep the liquor for us, my Lord, and let them drink [400] Brine, for I will not
show ’em the quick freshes of the Island.
STEPHANO
I understand, being present, from my Embassadors what your resolution
is, and ask an hours time of deliberation, and so I take our leave; but first
I desire to be entertain’d at your Butt, as becomes a Prince, and his
Embassadors.
TRINCALO
That I refuse, till acts of Hostility be ceas’d.
These Rogues are rather Spies than Embassadors;
I must take heed of my Butt. They come to pry
Into the secrets of my Dukedom.
VENTOSO
Trincalo you are a barbarous Prince, and so farewel.
[Exeunt Steph. Must. Vent.

65

FERDINAND
How far will this invisible Musician conduct
My steps? he hovers still about me, whether
For good or ill I cannot tell, nor care I much;
For I have been so long a slave to chance, that
I’m as weary of her flatteries as her frowns,
But here I am—
ARIEL
ere I am.
FERDINAND
[425] Hah! art thou so? the Spirit’s turn’d an Eccho:
This might seem pleasant, could the burthen of my
Griefs accord with any thing but sighs.
And my last words, like those of dying men
Need no reply. Fain I would go to shades, where
Few would wish to follow me.
ARIEL
Follow me.
FERDINAND
This evil Spirit grows importunate,
But I’le not take his counsel.
ARIEL
Take his counsel.

[Exeunt.

66

Dryden and Davenant

FERDINAND
It may be the Devil’s counsel. I’le never take it.
ARIEL
Take it.
FERDINAND
I will discourse no more with thee,
Nor follow one step further.
ARIEL
One step further.
FERDINAND
This must have more importance than an Eccho.
Some Spirit tempts to a precipice.
I’le try if it will answer when I sing
My sorrows to the murmurs of this Brook.
He sings.
Go thy way.
ARIEL
Go thy way.
FERDINAND
Why should’st thou stay?
ARIEL
Why should’st thou stay?
FERDINAND
Where the Winds whistle, and where the streams creep,
Under yond Willow-tree, fain would I sleep.
[450] Then let me alone,
For ’tis time to be gone.
ARIEL.
For ’tis time to be gone.

The Tempest

67

FERDINAND
What cares or pleasures can be in this Isle?
Within this desart place
There lives no humane race;
Fate cannot frown here, nor kind fortune smile.
ARIEL
Kind Fortune smiles, and she
Has yet in store for thee
Some strange felicity.
Follow me, follow me,
And thou shalt see.
FERDINAND
I’le take thy word for once;
Lead on Musician.

[Exeunt and return.

Scene changes, and discovers Prospero and Miranda.
PROSPERO
Advance the fringed Curtains of thine Eyes, and say what thou seest yonder.
MIRANDA
Is it a Spirit? Lord! how it looks about! Sir, I confess it carries a brave form.
But ’tis a Spirit.
PROSPERO
No Girl, it eats and sleeps, and has such senses as we have. This young
Gallant, whom thou see’st, was in the wrack; were he not somewhat stain’d
with grief (beauty’s worst Cancker) thou might’st call him a goodly person;
he has lost his company, and strays about to find ’em.
MIRANDA
I might call him a thing divine, for nothing natural I [475] ever saw so noble.
PROSPERO
It goes on as my Soul prompts it: Spirit, fine Spirit. I’le free thee within two
days for this.
FERDINAND
She’s sure the Mistress, on whom these airs attend. Fair Excellence, if, as
your form declares, you are divine, be pleas’d to instruct me how you will
be worship’d; so bright a beauty cannot sure belong to humane kind.

68

Dryden and Davenant

MIRANDA
I am, like you, a mortal, if such you are.
FERDINAND
My language too! O Heavens! I am the best of them who speak this speech,
when I’m in my own Country.
PROSPERO
How, the best? what wert thou if the Duke of Savoy heard thee?
FERDINAND
As I am now, who wonders to hear thee speak of Savoy: he does hear me,
and that he does I weep, my self am Savoy, whose fatal Eyes (e’re since at
ebbe) beheld the Duke my Father wrackt.
MIRANDA
Alack! for pity.
PROSPERO
At the first sight they have chang’d Eyes, dear Ariel,
I’le set thee free for this—young, Sir, a word.
With hazard of your self you do me wrong.
MIRANDA
Why speaks my Father so urgently?
This is the third man that e’re I saw, the first whom
E’re I sigh’d for, sweet Heaven move my Father
To be inclin’d my way.
FERDINAND
O! if a Virgin! and your affection not gone forth,
[500] I’le make you Mistress of Savoy.
PROSPERO
Soft, Sir! one word more.
They are in each others powers, but this swift
Bus’ness I must uneasie make, lest too light
Winning make the prize light—one word more.
Thou usurp’st the name not due to thee, and hast
Put thy self upon this Island as a spy to get the
Government from me, the Lord of it.

The Tempest

69

FERDINAND
No, as I’m a man.
MIRANDA
There’s nothing ill can dwell in such a Temple,
If th’ Evil Spirit hath so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell with it.
PROSPERO
No more. Speak not you for him, he’s a Traytor,
Come! thou art my Pris’ner and shalt be in
Bonds. Sea-water shalt thou drink, thy food
Shall be the fresh-Brook-Muscles, wither’d Roots,
And Husks, wherein the Acorn crawl’d; follow.
FERDINAND
No, I will resist such entertainment
Till my Enemy has more power.
[He draws, and is charm’d from moving.
MIRANDA
O dear Father! make not too rash a tryal
Of him, for he’s gentle and not fearful.
PROSPERO
My child my Tutor! put thy Sword up Traytor,
Who mak’st a show, but dar’st not strike: thy
Conscience is possest with guilt. Come from
Thy Ward, for I can here disarm thee with
[525] This Wand, and make thy Weapon drop.
MIRANDA
’Beseech you Father.
PROSPERO
Hence: hang not on my Garment.
MIRANDA
Sir, have pity,
I’le be his Surety.
PROSPERO
Silence! one word more shall make me chide thee,

70

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

If not hate thee: what, an advocate for an
Impostor? sure thou think’st there are no more
Such shapes as his?
To the most of men this is a Caliban,
And they to him are Angels.

PROSPERO TO MIRANDA
Go in that way, speak not a word for him:
I’le separate you.

[Exit Miranda.

FERDINAND
As soon thou may’st divide the waters
When thou strik’st ’em, which pursue thy bootless blow,
And meet when ’tis past.

MIRANDA
My affections are then most humble,
I have no ambition to see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO
Go practise your Philosophy within,
And if you are the same you speak your self,
Bear your afflictions like a Prince—That Door
Shews you your Lodging.

PROSPERO
Come on, obey:
Thy Nerves are in their infancy agen, and have
No vigour in them.
FERDINAND
So they are:
My Spirits, as in a Dream, are all bound up:
My Father’s loss, the weakness which I feel,
The wrack of all my friends, and this man’s threats,
To whom I am subdu’d, would seem light to me,
Might I but once a day through my Prison behold this maid:
All corners else o’th’ Earth let liberty make use of:
I have space enough in such a Prison.

FERDINAND
’Tis in vain to strive, I must obey.

PROSPERO
It works: come on:
[550] Thou hast done well, fine Ariel: follow me.
Heark what thou shalt more do for me.

HIPPOLITO ENTRING
’Tis Prospero’s voice.

PROSPERO
This goes as I would wish it.
Now for my second care, Hippolito:
I shall not need to chide him for his fault,
His passion is become his punishment.
Come forth, Hippolito.

[Whispers Ariel.

MIRANDA
Be of comfort!
My Father’s of a better nature, Sir,
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
Which now came from him.

PROSPERO
You think you have receiv’d no hurt.

[Exit Ariel.

[Exit. Ferd.

[Enter Hippolito.

PROSPERO
[575] Hippolito! I know you now expect I should severely chide you: you
have seen a woman in contempt of my commands.
HIPPOLITO
But, Sir, you see I am come off unharm’d;
I told you, that you need not doubt my courage.

PROSPERO
Thou shalt be as free as Mountain Winds:
But then exactly do all points of my command.
ARIEL
To a Syllable.

71

HIPPOLITO
No, none Sir.
Try me agen, when e’re you please I’m ready:
I think I cannot fear an Army of ’em.

72

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
How much in vain it is to bridle Nature!
Well! what was the success of your encounter?

The Tempest
HIPPOLITO
Whether we will or no, Sir, who shall make us?
[Aside.

HIPPOLITO
Sir, we had none, we yielded both at first,
For I took her to mercy, and she me.
PROSPERO
But are you not much chang’d from what you were?
HIPPOLITO
Methinks I wish and wish! for what I know not,
But still I wish—yet if I had that woman,
She, I believe, could tell me what I wish for.
PROSPERO
What wou’d you do to make that Woman yours?
HIPPOLITO
I’d quit the rest o’th’ world that I might live alone with
Her, she never should be from me.
We too would sit and look till our eyes ak’d.
PROSPERO
You’d soon be weary of her.
HIPPOLITO
O, Sir, never.
PROSPERO
ut you’l grow old and wrinckl’d, as you see me now,
And then you will not care for her.
HIPPOLITO
You may do what you please, but, Sir, we two can never [600] possibly grow
old.
PROSPERO
You must, Hippolito.

73

PROSPERO
Nature, which made me so.
HIPPOLITO
But you have told me her works are various;
She made you old, but she has made us young.
PROSPERO
Time will convince you,
Mean while be sure you tread in honours paths,
That you may merit her, and that you may not want
Fit occasions to employ your virtue, in this next
Cave there is a stranger lodg’d, one of your kind,
Young, of a noble presence, and as he says himself,
Of Princely birth, he is my Pris’ner and in deep
Affliction, visit, and comfort him; it will become you.
HIPPOLITO
It is my duty, Sir.

[Exit Hippolito.

PROSPERO
True, he has seen a woman, yet he lives, perhaps I took the moment of his
birth amiss, perhaps my Art it self is false: on what strange grounds we
build our hopes and fears, mans life is all a mist, and in the dark, our
fortunes meet us.
If Fate be not, then what can we foresee,
Or how can we avoid it, if it be?
If by free-will in our own paths we move,
How are we bounded by Decrees above?
Whether we drive, or whether we are driven,
If ill ’tis ours, if good the act of Heaven.
[Exit Prospero.
Enter Hippolito and Ferdinand.
Scene, a Cave.
FERDINAND
[625] Your pity, noble youth, doth much oblige me,
Indeed ’twas sad to lose a Father so.

74

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

HIPPOLITO
I, and an only Father too, for sure you said
You had but one.
FERDINAND
But one Father! he’s wondrous simple!

75

FERDINAND
They indeed are dangerous, for since I came I have beheld one here, whose
beauty pierc’d my heart.

[Aside.

HIPPOLITO
Are such misfortunes frequent in your world,
Where many men live?

HIPPOLITO
[650] How did she pierce? you seem not hurt.
FERDINAND
Alas! the wound was made by her bright eyes,
And festers by her absence.
But to speak plainer to you, Sir, I love her.

FERDINAND
Such we are born to.
But gentle youth, as you have question’d me,
So give me leave to ask you, what you are?

HIPPOLITO
Now I suspect that love’s the very thing, that I feel too! pray tell me truly,
Sir, are you not grown unquiet since you saw her?

HIPPOLITO
Do not you know?

FERDINAND
I take no rest.

FERDINAND
How should I?

HIPPOLITO
Just, just my disease.
Do you not wish you do not know for what?

HIPPOLITO
I well hop’d I was a man, but by your ignorance
Of what I am, I fear it is not so:
Well, Prospero! this is now the second time
You have deceiv’d me.
FERDINAND
Sir, there is no doubt you are a man:
But I would know of whence?
HIPPOLITO
Why, of this world, I never was in yours.
FERDINAND
ave you a Father?
HIPPOLITO
I was told I had one, and that he was a man, yet I have bin so much
deceived, I dare not tell’t you for a truth; but I have still been kept a
Prisoner for fear of women.

FERDINAND
O no! I know too well for what I wish.
HIPPOLITO
There, I confess, I differ from you, Sir:
But you desire she may be always with you?
FERDINAND
I can have no felicity without her.
HIPPOLITO
Just my condition! alas, gentle Sir,
I’le pity you, and you shall pity me.
FERDINAND
I love so much, that if I have her not,
I find I cannot live.
HIPPOLITO
How! do you love her?

76

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

And would you have her too? that must not be:
For none but I must have her.

77

Perhaps, sweet youth, when you behold her,
You will find you do not love her.

FERDINAND
But perhaps, we do not love the same:
All beauties are not pleasing alike to all.

HIPPOLITO
I find already I love, because she is another Woman.
FERDINAND
You cannot love two women, both at once.

HIPPOLITO
Why are there more fair Women, Sir,
Besides that one I love?
FERDINAND
[675] That’s a strange question. There are many more besides that beauty
which you love.

HIPPOLITO
Sure ’tis my duty to love all who do resemble
Her whom I’ve already seen. I’le have as many as I can,
That are so good, and Angel-like, as she I love.
And will have yours.

HIPPOLITO
I will have all of that kind, if there be a hundred of ’em.

FERDINAND
Pretty youth, you cannot.

FERDINAND
But noble youth, you know not what you say.

HIPPOLITO
I can do any thing for that I love.

HIPPOLITO
Sir, they are things I love, I cannot be without ’em:
O, how I rejoyce! more women!

FERDINAND
[700] I may, perhaps, by force restrain you from it.

FERDINAND
Sir, if you love you must be ty’d to one.

HIPPOLITO
Why do so if you can. But either promise me
To love no Woman, or you must try your force.

HIPPOLITO
Ty’d! how ty’d to her?

FERDINAND
I cannot help it, I must love.

FERDINAND
To love none but her.

HIPPOLITO
Well you may love, for Prospero taught me friendship too: you shall love
me and other men if you can find ’em, but all the Angel-women shall be
mine.

HIPPOLITO
But, Sir, I find it is against my Nature.
I must love where I like, and I believe I may like all,
All that are fair: come! bring me to this Woman,
For I must have her.
FERDINAND
His simplicity
Is such that I can scarce be angry with him.

[Aside.

FERDINAND
I must break off this conference, or he will
Urge me else beyond what I can bear.
Sweet youth! some other time we will speak
Further concerning both our loves; at present
I am indispos’d with weariness and grief,
And would, if you are pleas’d, retire a while.

78

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

79

PROSPERO
This may secure Hippolito from that dark danger which my art forebodes;
for friendship does provide a double strength t’oppose th’assaults of
fortune.
[Exit Prospero.

HIPPOLITO
Some other time be it; but, Sir, remember
That I both seek and much intreat your friendship,
For next to Women, I find I can love you.

Enter Ferdinand.
FERDINAND
I thank you, Sir, I will consider of it.
HIPPOLITO
This Stranger does insult and comes into my
World to take those heavenly beauties from me,
Which I believe I am inspir’d to love,
And yet he said he did desire but one.
He would be poor in love, but I’le be rich:
I now perceive that Prospero was cunning;
For when he frighted me from woman-kind,
Those precious things he for himself design’d.

[Exit Ferdinand.

MIRANDA
Sir! my Lord? where are you?

[Exit.

FERDINAND
O heavenly Creature! ten times more gentle, than your Father’s cruel, how
on a sudden all my griefs are vanish’d!

Enter Prospero, and Miranda.

MIRANDA
You shall be obey’d in all things.
PROSPERO
Be earnest to unite their very souls.
MIRANDA
I shall endeavour it.

FERDINAND
Is it your voice, my Love? or do I dream?
MIRANDA
Speak softly, it is I.

ACT IV.

PROSPERO
YOUR suit has pity in’t, and has prevail’d.
Within this Cave he lies, and you may see him:
But yet take heed; let Prudence be your Guide;
You must not stay, your visit must be short.
One thing I had forgot; insinuate into his mind
A kindness to that youth, whom first you saw;
I would have friendship grow betwixt’em.

FERDINAND
To be a Pris’ner where I dearly love, is but a double tye; a Link of fortune
joyn’d to the chain of love; but not to see her, and yet to be so near her,
there’s the hardship; I feel my self as on a Rack, stretch’d out, and nigh the
ground, on which I might have ease, yet cannot reach it.

MIRANDA
I come to help you to support your griefs.
[She’s going.
FERDINAND
[25] While I stand gazing thus, and thus have leave to touch your hand, I do
not envy freedom.
MIRANDA
Heark! heark! is’t not my Father’s voice I hear? I fear he calls me back again
too soon.
FERDINAND
Leave fear to guilty minds: ’tis scarce a virtue when it is paid to Heaven.
MIRANDA
But there ’tis mix’d with love, and so is mine; yet I may fear, for I am guilty
when I disobey my Fathers will in loving you too much.

80

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

81

which you can ever pay him.
FERDINAND
But you please Heav’n in disobeying him,
Heav’n bids you succour Captives in distress.
MIRANDA
How do you bear your Prison?
FERDINAND
’Tis my Palace while you are here, and love and silence wait upon our
wishes; do but think we chuse it, and ’tis what we would chuse.
MIRANDA
I’m sure what I would.
But how can I be certain that you love me?
Look to’t; for I will dye when you are false.
I’ve heard my Father tell of Maids, who dy’d,
And haunted their false Lovers with their Ghosts.
FERDINAND
Your Ghost must take another form to fright me,
This shape will be too pleasing: do I love you?
O Heav’n! O Earth! bear witness to this sound,
If I prove false—
MIRANDA
Oh hold, you shall not swear;
[50] For Heav’n will hate you if you prove forsworn.

FERDINAND
You mean your Father: do not think his usage can make me hate him; when
he gave you being, he then did that which cancell’d all these wrongs.
MIRANDA
I mean not him, for that was a request which if you love I should not need
to urge.
FERDINAND
Is there another whom I ought to love?
And love him for your sake?
MIRANDA
Yes such a one, who for his sweetness and his goodly shape, (if I, who am
unskill’d in forms, may judge) I think can scarce be equall’d: ’Tis a youth,
a Stranger too as you are.
FERDINAND
Of such a graceful feature, and must I for your sake love?
MIRANDA
Yes, Sir, do you scruple to grant the first request I ever made? he’s wholly
unacquainted with the world, and wants [75] your conversation. You should
have compassion on so meer a stranger.
FERDINAND
Those need compassion whom you discommend, not whom you praise.

FERDINAND
Did I not love, I could no more endure this undeserved captivity, then I
could wish to gain my freedom with the loss of you.

MIRANDA
I only ask this easie tryal of you.

MIRANDA
I am a fool to weep at what I’m glad of: but I have a suit to you, and that,
Sir, shall be now the only tryal of your love.

FERDINAND
Perhaps it might have easier bin
If you had never ask’d it.

FERDINAND
Y’ave said enough, never to be deny’d, were it my life; for you have far
o’rebid the price of all that humane life is worth.

MIRANDA
I cannot understand you; and methinks am loth
To be more knowing.

MIRANDA
Sir, ’tis to love one for my sake, who for his own deserves all the respect

FERDINAND
He has his freedom, and may get access, when my

82

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

Confinement makes me want that blessing.
I his compassion need, and not he mine.

MIRANDA
I fear I have offended you, and yet I meant no harm:
But if you please to hear me—
Heark! Sir! now I am sure my Father comes, I know
His steps; dear Love retire a while, I fear
I’ve stay’d too long.

MIRANDA
If that be all you doubt, trust me for him.
He has a melting heart, and soft to all the Seals
Of kindness; I will undertake for his compassion.

[A noise within.

FERDINAND
Too long indeed, and yet not long enough: oh jealousie!
Oh Love! how you distract me?
[Exit Ferdinand

FERDINAND
O Heavens! would I were sure I did not need it.
MIRANDA
Come, you must love him for my sake: you shall.

MIRANDA
He appears displeas’d with that young man, I know
Not why: but, till I find from whence his hate proceeds,
I must conceal it from my Fathers knowledge,
For he will think that guiltless I have caus’d it;
And suffer me no more to see my Love.
[Enter Prospero.

FERDINAND
Must I for yours, and cannot for my own?
Either you do not love, or think that I do not:
But when you bid me love him, I must hate him.

PROSPERO
Now I have been indulgent to your wish,
You have seen the Prisoner?

MIRANDA
Have I so far offended you already,
That he offends you only for my sake?
Yet sure you would not hate him, if you saw
Him as I have done, so full of youth and beauty.
FERDINAND
O poyson to my hopes!
[100] When he did visit me, and I did mention this
eauteous Creature to him, he did then tell me
He would have her.

83

MIRANDA
[125] Yes.

[Aside.

PROSPERO
And he spake to you?
MIRANDA
He spoke; but he receiv’d short answers from me.

MIRANDA
Alas, what mean you?

PROSPERO
How like you his converse?

FERDINAND
It is too plain: like most of her frail Sex, she’s false,
But has not learnt the art to hide it;
Nature has done her part, she loves variety:
Why did I think that any Woman could be innocent,
Because she’s young? No, no, their Nurses teach them
Change, when with two Nipples they divide their
Liking.

MIRANDA
At second sight
A man does not appear so rare a Creature.
PROSPERO ASIDE
I find she loves him much because she hides it.
Love teaches cunning even to innocence,
And where he gets possession, his first work is to
Dig deep within a heart, and there lie hid,

84

Dryden and Davenant

And like a Miser in the dark to feast alone.
But tell me, dear Miranda, how does he suffer
His imprisonment?
MIRANDA
I think he seems displeas’d.
PROSPERO
O then ’tis plain his temper is not noble,
For the brave with equal minds bear good
And evil fortune.
MIRANDA
O, Sir, but he’s pleas’d again so soon
That ’tis not worth your noting.
PROSPERO
To be soon displeas’d and pleas’d so suddenly again,
Does shew him of a various froward Nature.
MIRANDA
The truth is, Sir, he was not vex’d at all, but only
Seem’d to be so.
PROSPERO
If he be not and yet seems angry, he is a dissembler,
Which shews the worst of Natures.
MIRANDA
[150] Truly, Sir, the man has faults enough; but in my conscience that’s none
of ’em. He can be no dissembler.
PROSPERO ASIDE
How she excuses him, and yet desires that I should judge her heart
indifferent to him? well, since his faults are many, I am glad you love him
not.
MIRANDA
’Tis like, Sir, they are many,
But I know none he has, yet let me often see him
And I shall find ’em all in time.

The Tempest

85

PROSPERO
I’le think on’t.
Go in, this is your hour of Orizons.
MIRANDA ASIDE
Forgive me, truth, for thus disguising thee; if I can make him think I do not
love the stranger much, he’ll let me see him oftner.
[Exit Miranda.
PROSPERO
Stay! stay—I had forgot to ask her what she has said
Of young Hippolito: Oh! here he comes! and with him
My Dorinda. I’le not be seen, let
[Ent. Hippolito and Dorinda.
Their loves grow in secret.
[Exit Prospero.
HIPPOLITO
But why are you so sad?
DORINDA
But why are you so joyful?
HIPPOLITO
I have within me all, all the various Musick of
The Woods. Since last I saw you I have heard brave news!
I’le tell you, and make you joyful for me.
DORINDA
Sir, when I saw you first, I through my eyes drew
Something in, I know not what it is;
But still it entertains me with such thoughts
[175] As makes me doubtful whether joy becomes me.
HIPPOLITO
Pray believe me;
As I’m a man, I’le tell you blessed news.
I have heard there are more Women in the World,
As fair as you are too.
DORINDA
Is this your news? you see it moves not me.
HIPPOLITO
And I’le have ’em all.

86

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

DORINDA
What will become of me then?

DORINDA
She is my Sister, and therefore I must love her:
But you cannot love both of us.

HIPPOLITO
I’le have you too.
But are not you acquainted with these Women?

HIPPOLITO
I warrant you I can:
Oh that you had more Sisters!

DORINDA
I never saw but one.

DORINDA
ou may love her, but then I’le not love you.

HIPPOLITO
s there but one here?
This is a base poor world, I’le go to th’ other;
I’ve heard men have abundance of ’em there.
But pray where is that one Woman?

HIPPOLITO
O but you must;
One is enough for you, but not for me.

DORINDA
Who, my Sister?
HIPPOLITO
Is she your Sister? I’m glad o’that: you shall help me to her, and I’le love
you for’t.
[Offers to take her hand.
DORINDA
Away! I will not have you touch my hand.
My Father’s counsel which enjoyn’d reservedness,
Was not in vain I see.
HIPPOLITO
What makes you shun me?
DORINDA
You need not care, you’l have my Sisters hand.
HIPPOLITO
Why, must not he who touches hers touch yours?
DORINDA
You mean to love her too.
HIPPOLITO
[200] Do not you love her?
Then why should not I do so?

DORINDA
My Sister told me she had seen another;
A man like you, and she lik’d only him;
Therefore if one must be enough for her,
He is that one, and then you cannot have her.
HIPPOLITO
If she like him, she may like both of us.

[Aside.

DORINDA
But how if I should change and like that man?
Would you be willing to permit that change?
HIPPOLITO
No, for you lik’d me first.
DORINDA
So you did me.
HIPPOLITO
But I would never have you see that man;
I cannot bear it.
DORINDA
I’le see neither of you.

87

88

Dryden and Davenant

HIPPOLITO
Yes, me you may, for we are now acquainted;
But he’s the man of whom your Father warn’d you:
O! he’s a terrible, huge, monstrous creature,
I am but a Woman to him.

The Tempest

89

Another: all the Creatures of the Rivers and
The Woods are so.

[Enter Ferdinand.

FERDINAND
O! well encounter’d, you are the happy man!
Y’ have got the hearts of both the beauteous Women.

DORINDA
[225] I will see him,
Except you’l promise not to see my Sister.

HIPPOLITO
How! Sir? pray, are you sure on’t?

HIPPOLITO
Yes for your sake I needs must see your Sister.

FERDINAND
One of ’em charg’d me to love you for her sake.

DORINDA
ut she’s a terrible, huge Creature too; if I were not
Her Sister she would eat me; therefore take heed.

HIPPOLITO
[250] Then I must have her.
FERDINAND
No, not till I am dead.

HIPPOLITO
I heard that she was fair, and like you.

HIPPOLITO
How dead? what’s that? but whatsoe’re it be
I long to have her.

DORINDA
No, indeed, she’s like my Father, with a great Beard,
’Twould fright you to look on her,
Therefore that man and she may go together,
They are fit for no body but one another.

FERDINAND
Time and my grief may make me dye.

HIPPOLITO LOOKING IN
Yonder he comes with glaring eyes, fly! fly! before he sees you.
DORINDA
Must we part so soon?

FERDINAND
I see your ignorance;
And therefore will instruct you in my meaning.
The Woman, whom I love, saw you and lov’d you.
Now, Sir, if you love her you’l cause my death.

HIPPOLITO
Y’are a lost Woman if you see him.
DORINDA
I would not willingly be lost, for fear you
Should not find me. I’le avoid him.
HIPPOLITO
She fain would have deceived me, but I know her
Sister must be fair, for she’s a Woman;
All of a Kind that I have seen are like to one

HIPPOLITO
But for a friend you should make haste; I ne’re ask’d
Any thing of you before.

[Exit Dorinda.

HIPPOLITO
Besure I’le do’t then.
FERDINAND
But I am your friend;
And I request you that you would not love her.

90

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

HIPPOLITO
When friends request unreasonable things,
Sure th’are to be deny’d: you say she’s fair,
And I must love all who are fair; for, to tell
You a secret, Sir, which I have lately found
Within my self; they all are made for me.

HIPPOLITO
I have not yet consider’d what is right, but, Sir,
I know my inclinations are to love all Women:
And I have been taught that to dissemble what I
Think is base. In honour then of truth, I must
Declare that I do love, and I will see your Woman.

FERDINAND
That’s but a fond conceit: you are made for one, and one for you.

FERDINAND
Wou’d you be willing I should see and love your
Woman, and endeavour to seduce her from that
Affection which she vow’d to you?

HIPPOLITO
You cannot tell me, Sir,
I know I’m made for twenty hundred Women.
(I mean if there so many be i’th’ World)
So that if once I see her I shall love her.
FERDINAND
[275] Then do not see her.
HIPPOLITO
Yes, Sir, I must see her.
For I wou’d fain have my heart beat again,
Just as it did when I first saw her Sister.
FERDINAND
I find I must not let you see her then.
HIPPOLITO
How will you hinder me?
FERDINAND
By force of Arms.
HIPPOLITO
By force of Arms?
My Arms perhaps may be as strong as yours.
FERDINAND
He’s still so ignorant that I pity him, and fain
Would avoid force: pray, do not see her, she was
Mine first; you have no right to her.

HIPPOLITO
I wou’d not you should do it, but if she should
Love you best, I cannot hinder her.
But, Sir, for fear she shou’d, I will provide against
The worst, and try to get your Woman.
FERDINAND
But I pretend no claim at all to yours;
[300] Besides you are more beautiful than I,
And fitter to allure unpractis’d hearts.
Therefore I once more beg you will not see her.
HIPPOLITO
I’m glad you let me know I have such beauty.
If that will get me Women, they shall have it
As far as e’re ’twill go: I’le never want ’em.
FERDINAND
Then since you have refused this act of friendship,
Provide your self a Sword; for we must fight.
HIPPOLITO
A Sword, what’s that?
FERDINAND
Why such a thing as this.
HIPPOLITO
What should I do with it?

91

92

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

FERDINAND
You must stand thus, and push against me,
While I push at you, till one of us fall dead.

HIPPOLITO
I’le warrant you I’le push you.

93

[Exeunt severally.

Enter Trincalo, Caliban, Sycorax.
HIPPOLITO
This is brave sport,
But we have no Swords growing in our World.

CALIBAN
My Lord, I see ’em coming yonder.

FERDINAND
What shall we do then to decide our quarrel?

TRINCALO
Who?

HIPPOLITO
We’ll take the Sword by turns, and fight with it.

CALIBAN
The starv’d Prince, and his two thirsty Subjects,
That would have our Liquor.

FERDINAND
Strange ignorance! you must defend your life,
And so must I: but since you have no Sword
Take this; for in a corner of my Cave
I found a rusty one, perhaps ’twas his who keeps
Me Pris’ner here: that I will fit:
When next we meet prepare your self to fight.

[Gives him his sword.

HIPPOLITO
Make haste then, this shall ne’re be yours agen.
I mean to fight with all the men I meet, and
[325] When they are dead, their Women shall be mine.
FERDINAND
I see you are unskilful; I desire not to take
Your life, but if you please we’ll fight on
These conditions; He who first draws bloud,
Or who can take the others Weapon from him,
Shall be acknowledg’d as the Conquerour,
And both the Women shall be his.

TRINCALO
If thou wert a Monster of parts I would make thee
My Master of Ceremonies, to conduct ’em in.
The Devil take all Dunces, thou hast lost a brave
Employment by not being a Linguist, and for want
Of behaviour.
SYCORAX
My Lord, shall I go meet ’em? I’le be kind to all of ’em,
Just as I am to thee.
TRINCALO
No, that’s against the fundamental Laws of my Dukedom: you are in a high
place, Spouse, and must give good Example. Here they come, we’ll put on
the gravity of Statesmen, [350] and be very dull, that we may be held wise.
Enter Stephano, Ventoso, Mustacho.
VENTOSO
Duke Trincalo, we have consider’d.

HIPPOLITO
Agreed,
And ev’ry day I’le fight for two more with you.

TRINCALO
Peace, or War.

FERDINAND
But win these first.

MUSTACHO
Peace, and the Butt.

94

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

STEPHANO
I come now as a private person, and promise to live peaceably under your
Government.
TRINCALO
You shall enjoy the benefits of Peace; and the first Fruits of it, amongst all
civil Nations, is to be drunk for joy: Caliban skink about.
STEPHANO
I long to have a Rowse to her Graces health, and to the Haunse in Kelder,
or rather Haddock in Kelder, for I guess it will be half Fish.
[Aside.
TRINCALO
Subject Stephano here’s to thee; and let old quarrels be drown’d in this
draught.
[Drinks.
STEPHANO
Great Magistrate, here’s thy Sisters health to thee.

95

SYCORAX
Shall we call? and thou shalt hear them in the Air.
TRINCALO
I accept the motion: let us have our Mother-in-Law’s Legacy immediately.
CALIBAN SINGS.
We want Musick, we want Mirth,
Up Dam and cleave the Earth,
We have now no Lords that wrong us,
Send thy merry Sprights among us.

[Musick heard.

TRINCALO
What a merry Tyrant am I, to have my
Musick and pay nothing for’t? come hands, hands,
Let’s lose no time while the Devil’s in the
Humour.

[A Dance.

[Drinks to Caliban.

SYCORAX
He shall not drink of that immortal liquor,
My Lord, let him drink water.
TRINCALO
sweet heart, you must not shame your self to day.
Gentlemen Subjects, pray bear with her good Huswifry:
She wants a little breeding, but she’s hearty.
MUSTACHO
Ventoso here’s to thee. It is not better to pierce the Butt, than to quarrel
and pierce one anothers bellies?
VENTOSO
Let it come Boy.
TRINCALO
Now wou’d I lay greatness aside, and shake my heels, if I had but Musick.
CALIBAN
[375] O my Lord! my Mother left us in her Will a hundred Spirits to attend
us, Devils of all forts, some great roaring Devils, and some little singing
Sprights.

TRINCALO
Enough, enough: now to our Sack agen.
VENTOSO
The Bottle’s drunk.
MUSTACHO
Then the Bottle’s a weak shallow fellow if it be drunk first.
TRINCALO
Caliban, give Bottle the belly full agen.
STEPHANO
May I ask your Grace a question? pray is that hectoring Spark, as you call’d
him, flesh or fish?
TRINCALO
Subject I know not, but he drinks like a fish.
STEPHANO
O here’s the Bottle agen; he has made a good voyage,
Come, who begins a Brindis to the Duke?
TRINCALO
I’le begin it my self: give me the Bottle; ’tis my

[Enter Caliban.

96

Dryden and Davenant

to drink first; Stephano, give me thy hand,
Thou hast been a Rebel, but here’s to thee,
Prithee why should we quarrel? shall I swear
Two Oaths? by Bottle, and by Butt I love thee:
In witness whereof I drink soundly.

The Tempest

[400] Prerogative

[Drinks.

STEPHANO
Your Grace shall find there’s no love lost,
For I will pledge you soundly.
TRINCALO
Thou hast been a false Rebel, but that’s all one;
Pledge my Grace faithfully.
STEPHANO
I will pledge your Grace Up se Dutch.
TRINCALO
But thou shalt not pledge me before I have drunk agen, would’st thou take
the Liquor of Life out of my hands; I see thou art a piece of a Rebel still, but
here’s to thee, now thou shalt have it.
[Stephano drinks.
VENTOSO
We loyal Subjects may be choak’d for any drink we can get.
TRINCALO
Have patience good people, you are unreasonable, you’d be drunk as soon
as I. Ventoso you shall have your time, but you must give place to Stephano.
MUSTACHO
Brother Ventoso, I am afraid we shall lose our places.
The Duke grows fond of Stephano, and will declare him
Vice-Roy.
STEPHANO
I ha’ done my worst at your Graces Bottle.
TRINCALO
Then the Folks may have it. Caliban
Go to the Butt, and tell me how it sounds:
[425] Peer Stephano, dost thou love me?

97

STEPHANO
I love your Grace and all your Princely Family.
TRINCALO
’Tis no matter if thou lov’st me; hang my Family:
Thou art my Friend, prithee tell me what
Thou think’st of my Princess?
STEPHANO
I look on her as on a very noble Princess.
TRINCALO
Noble? indeed she had a Witch to her Mother, and the Witches are of great
Families in Lapland, but the Devil was her Father, and I have heard of the
Mounsor De-Viles in France; but look on her beauty, is she a fit Wife for
Duke Trincalo? mark her behaviour too, she’s tippling yonder with the
serving-men.
STEPHANO
An please your Grace she’s somewhat homely, but that’s no blemish in a
Princess. She is virtuous.
TRINCALO
Umph! virtuous! I am loth to disparage her;
But thou art my Friend, canst thou be close?
STEPHANO
As a stopt Bottle, an’t please your Grace.
[Enter Caliban agen with a Bottle.
TRINCALO
Why then I’le tell thee, I found her an hour ago under an Elder-tree, upon
a sweet Bed of Nettles, singing Tory, Rory, and Ranthum, Scantum, with
her own natural Brother.
STEPHANO
O Jew! make love in her own Tribe?
TRINCALO
But ’tis no matter, to tell thee true, I marry’d her to be a great man and so
forth: but make no words on’t, for I care not who knows it, and so here’s to
thee agen, give me the Bottle, Caliban! did you knock the Butt? how does
it sound?

98

Dryden and Davenant

TRINCALO
I fear the Butt begins to rattle in the throat and is departing: give me the
Bottle.
[Drinks.

[Steph. whispers Sycorax.

SYCORAX
But did he tell you so?
STEPHANO
He said you were as ugly as your Mother, and that he Marry’d you only to
get possession of the Island.
SYCORAX
My Mothers Devils fetch him for’t.
STEPHANO
And your Fathers too, hem! skink about his Graces health agen. O if you
would but cast an eye of pity upon me—
SYCORAX
I will cast two eyes of pity on thee, I love thee more than Haws, or Blackberries, I have a hoard of Wildings in the Moss, my Brother knows not of
’em; But I’le bring thee where they are.
STEPHANO
Trincalo was but my man when time was.
SYCORAX
Wert thou his God, and didst thou give him Liquor?
STEPHANO
I gave him Brandy and drunk Sack my self; wilt thou leave him, and thou
shalt be my Princess?
SYCORAX
If thou canst make me glad with this Liquor.

99

STEPHANO
I warrant thee we’ll ride into the Country where it grows.

CALIBAN
[450] It sounds as though it had a noise within.

MUSTACHO
A short life and a merry I say.

The Tempest

SYCORAX
How wilt thou carry me thither?
STEPHANO
Upon a Hackney-Devil of thy Mothers.
TRINCALO
What’s that you will do? hah! I hope you have not betray’d me? How does
my Pigs-nye?
[To Sycorax.
SYCORAX
[475] Be gone! thou shalt not be my Lord, thou say’st
I’m ugly.
TRINCALO
Did you tell her so—hah! he’s a Rogue, do not believe him chuck.
STEPHANO
The foul words were yours: I will not eat ’em for you.
TRINCALO
I see if once a Rebel, then ever a Rebel. Did I receive thee into grace for this?
I will correct thee with my Royal Hand.
[Strikes Stephano.
SYCORAX
Dost thou hurt my love?

[Flies at Trincalo.

TRINCALO
Where are our Guards? Treason, Treason!
[Vent. Must. Calib. run betwixt.
VENTOSO
Who took up Arms first, the Prince or the People?
TRINCALO
This false Traytor has corrupted the Wife of my Bosom.
[Whispers Mustacho hastily.
Mustacho strike on my side, and thou shalt be my Vice-Roy.

100

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

MUSTACHO
I’m against Rebels! Ventoso obey your Vice-Roy.

FERDINAND
Sir, you are wounded.

VENTOSO
You a Vice-Roy?

HIPPOLITO
No.

[They two fight off from the rest.

STEPHANO
Hah! Hector Monster! do you stand neuter?

FERDINAND
Believe your blood.

CALIBAN
Thou would’st drink my Liquor, I will not help thee.

HIPPOLITO
I feel no hurt, no matter for my blood.

SYCORAX
’Twas his doing that I had such a Husband, but I’le claw him.

FERDINAND
Remember our Conditions.

Syc. and Calib. fight, Syc. beating him off the Stage.
TRINCALO
The whole Nation is up in Arms, and shall I stand idle?
[Trincalo beats off Stephano to the door. Exit Stephano.
I’le not pursue too far, For fear the Enemy should rally agen and surprise
my Butt in the Cittadel; well, I must be rid of my Lady Trincalo, she will be
in the fashion else; first Cuckold her Husband, and then sue for a
separation, to get Alimony.
[Exit.

101

HIPPOLITO
I’le not leave, till my Sword hits you too.
[Hip. presses on, Ferd. retires and wards.
FERDINAND
I’m loth to kill you, you are unskilful, Sir.
HIPPOLITO
You beat aside my Sword, but let it come as near
As yours, and you shall see my skill.

Enter Ferdinand, Hippolito, (with their swords drawn.)
FERDINAND
[500] Come, Sir, our Cave afford no choice of place,
But the ground’s firm and even: are you ready?
HIPPOLITO
As ready as your self, Sir.
FERDINAND
You remember on what conditions we must fight?
Who first receives a Wound is to submit.
HIPPOLITO
Come, come, this loses time, now for the
Women, Sir.
[They fight a little, Ferdinand hurts him.

FERDINAND
You faint for loss of blood, I see you stagger,
Pray, Sir, retire.
HIPPOLITO
No! I will ne’re go back—
Methinks the Cave turns round, I cannot find—
FERDINAND
Your eyes begin to dazle.
HIPPOLITO
Why do you swim so, and dance about me?
Stand but still till I have made one thrust. [Hippolito thrusts and falls.
FERDINAND
O help, help, help!

102

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

Unhappy man! what have I done?
HIPPOLITO
[525] I’m going to a cold sleep, but when I wake
I’le fight agen. Pray stay for me.
FERDINAND
He’s gone! he’s gone! O stay sweet lovely Youth!
Help, help!

[Swounds.

[Enter Prospero.

PROSPERO
What dismal noise is that?
FERDINAND
O see, Sir, see!
What mischief my unhappy hand has wrought.
PROSPERO
Alas! how much in vain doth feeble Art endeavour
To resist the will of Heaven?
He’s gone for ever; O thou cruel Son of an
Inhumane Father! all my designs are ruin’d
And unravell’d by this blow.
No pleasure now is left me but Revenge.

[Rubs Hippolito.

ARIEL
Here, at thy beck, my Lord.
PROSPERO
I, now thou com’st, when Fate is past and not to be
Recall’d. Look there, and glut the malice of
Thy Nature, for as thou art thy self, thou
Canst not be but glad to see young Virtue
Nipt i’th’ Blossom.

ARIEL
My Lord, the Being high above can witness
I am not glad, we Airy Spirits are not of temper
[550] So malicious as the Earthy,
But of a Nature more approaching good.
For which we meet in swarms, and often combat
Betwixt the Confines of the Air and Earth.
PROSPERO
Why did’st thou not prevent, at least foretell
This fatal action then?
ARIEL
Pardon, great Sir,
I meant to do it, but I was forbidden
By the ill Genius of Hippolito,
Who came and threatn’d me if I disclos’d it,
To bind me in the bottom of the Sea,
Far from the lightsome Regions of the Air,
(My native fields) above a hundred years.
PROSPERO
I’le chain thee in the North for thy neglect,
Within the burning Bowels of Mount Heila,
I’le sindge thy airy wings with sulph’rous flames,
And choak thy tender nostrils with blew smoak,
At ev’ry Hick-up of the belching Mountain
Thou shalt be lifted up to taste fresh Air,
And then fall down agen.

FERDINAND
Sir, if you knew my innocence—
PROSPERO
Peace, peace,
Can thy excuses give me back his life?
What Ariel! sluggish spirit, where art thou?

103

[Enter Ariel.

ARIEL
Pardon, dread Lord.
PROSPERO
No more of pardon than just Heav’n intends thee
Shalt thou e’re find from me: hence! flye with speed,
Unbind the Charms which hold this Murtherer’s
Father, and bring him with my Brother streight
[575] Before me.
ARIEL
Mercy, my potent Lord, and I’le outfly thy thought.

[Exit Ariel.

104

Dryden and Davenant

FERDINAND
O Heavens! what words are those I heard?
Yet cannot see who spoke ’em: sure the Woman
Whom I lov’d was like this, some aiery Vision.
PROSPERO
No, Murd’rer, she’s, like thee, of mortal mould,
But much too pure to mix with thy black Crimes;
Yet she had faults and must be punish’d for’em.
Miranda and Dorinda! where are ye?
The will of Heaven’s accomplish’d: I have
Now no more to fear, and nothing left to hope,
Now you may enter.
[Enter Miranda and Dorinda.
MIRANDA
My Love! is it permitted me to see you once again?
PROSPERO
You come to look your last; I will
For ever take him from your Eyes.
But, on my blessing, speak not, nor approach him.
DORINDA
Pray, Father, is not this my Sisters man?
He has a noble form; but yet he’s not so excellent
As my Hippolito.
PROSPERO
Alas poor Girl, thou hast no man: look yonder;
There’s all of him that’s left.
DORINDA
Why was there ever any more of him?
He lies asleep, Sir, shall I waken him?
[She kneels by Hippolito, and jogs him.
FERDINAND
Alas! he’s never to be wak’d agen.
DORINDA
My Love, my Love! will you not speak to me?
[600] I fear you have displeas’d him, Sir, and now
He will not answer me, he’s dumb and cold too,

The Tempest

105

But I’le run streight, and make a fire to warm him.
[Exit Dorinda running.
Enter Alonzo, Gonzalo, Antonio. Ariel (invisible.)
ALONZO
Never were Beasts so hunted into toyls,
As we have been pursu’d by dreadful shapes.
But is not that my Son? O Ferdinand!
If thou art not a Ghost, let me embrace thee.
FERDINAND
My Father! O sinister happiness! Is it
Decreed I should recover you alive, just in that
Fatal hour when this brave Youth is lost in Death,
And by my hand?
ANTONIO
eaven! what new wonder’s this?
GONZALO
This Isle is full of nothing else.
ALONZO
I thought to dye, and in the walks above,
Wand’ring by Star-light, to have sought thee out;
But now I should have gone to Heaven in vain,
Whilst thou art here behind.
FERDINAND
You must indeed in vain have gone thither
To look for me. Those who are stain’d with such black
Crimes as mine, come seldom there.
PROSPERO
And those who are, like him, all foul with guilt,
More seldom upward go. You stare upon me as
You n’ere had seen me; have fifteen years
So lost me to your knowledge, that you retain
No memory of Prospero?
GONZALO
[625] The good old Duke of Millain!

106

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

PROSPERO
I wonder less, that thou Antonio know’st me not,
Because thou did’st long since forget I was thy Brother,
Else I never had bin here.

ALONZO
And think’st thou I or these will tamely stand
To view the execution?
[Lays hand upon his Sword.
FERDINAND
Hold, dear Father! I cannot suffer you
T’ attempt against his life who gave her being
Whom I love.

ANTONIO
Shame choaks my words.
ALONZO
And wonder mine.
PROSPERO
For you, usurping Prince,
Know, by my Art, you shipwrackt on this Isle,
Where, after I a while had punish’d you, my vengeance
Wou’d have ended, I design’d to match that Son
Of yours with this my Daughter.
ALONZO
Pursue it still, I am most willing to’t.
PROSPERO
So am not I. No marriages can prosper
Which are with Murd’rers made; look on that Corps,
This, whilst he liv’d, was young Hippolito, that
Infant Duke of Mantua, Sir, whom you expos’d
With me; and here I bred him up till that blood-thirsty
Man, that Ferdinand—
But why do I exclaim on him, when Justice calls
To unsheath her Sword against his guilt?
ALONZO
What do you mean?
PROSPERO
To execute Heav’ns Laws.
Here I am plac’d by Heav’n, here I am Prince,
Though you have dispossess’d me of my Millain.
Blood calls for blood; your Ferdinand shall dye,
[650] And I in bitterness have sent for you
To have the sudden joy of seeing him alive,
And then the greater grief to see him dye.

107

[To Alonzo.

PROSPERO
Nay then appear my Guards—I thought no more to
Use their aids; (I’m curs’d because I us’d it)
[He stamps, and many Spirits appear.
But they are now the Ministers of Heaven,
Whilst I revenge this murder.
ALONZO
ave I for this found thee my Son, so soon agen
To lose thee? Antonio, Gonzalo, speak for pity:
He may hear you.
ANTONIO
I dare not draw that blood upon my self, by
Interceding for him.
GONZALO
You drew this judgment down when you usurp’d
That Dukedom which was this dead Prince’s right.
ALONZO
Is this a time t’upbraid me with my sins, when
Grief lies heavy on me? y’are no more my friends,
But crueller than he, whose sentence has
Doom’d my Son to death.
ANTONIO
You did unworthily t’upbraid him.
GONZALO
And you do worse t’endure his crimes.

108

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

ANTONIO
[675] Gonzalo we’ll meet no more as friends.

DORINDA
Dead, Sir, what’s that?

GONZALO
Agreed Antonio: and we agree in discord.

PROSPERO
His soul has left his body.

FERDINAND TO MIRANDA
Adieu my fairest Mistress.

DORINDA
When will it come agen?

MIRANDA
Now I can hold no longer; I must speak.
Though I am loth to disobey you, Sir,
Be not so cruel to the man I love,
Or be so kind to let me suffer with him.

PROSPERO
O never, never!
[700] He must be laid in Earth, and there consume.

FERDINAND
Recall that Pray’r, or I shall wish to live,
Though death be all the mends that I can make.
PROSPERO
This night I will allow you, Ferdinand, to fit
You for your Death, that Cave’s your Prison.
ALONZO
Ah, Prospero! hear me speak. You are a Father,
Look on my age, and look upon his youth.
PROSPERO
No more! all you can say is urg’d in vain,
I have no room for pity left within me.
Do you refuse! help Ariel with your fellows
To drive ’em in; Alonzo and his Son bestow in
Yonder Cave, and here Gonzalo shall with
Antonio lodge.
[Spirits drive ’em in, as they are appointed.
Enter Dorinda.
DORINDA
Sir, I have made a fire, shall he be warm’d?
PROSPERO
He’s dead, and vital warmth will ne’re return.

109

DORINDA
He shall not lye in earth, you do not know
How well he loves me: indeed he’l come agen;
He told me he would go a little while,
But promis’d me he would not tarry long.
PROSPERO
He’s murder’d by the man who lov’d your Sister.
Now both of you may see what ’tis to break
A Father’s precept; you would needs see men, and by
That sight are made for ever wretched.
Hippolito is dead, and Ferdinand must dye
For murdering him.
MIRANDA
Have you no pity?
PROSPERO
Your disobedience has so much incens’d me, that
I this night can leave no blessing with you.
Help to convey the body to my Couch,
Then leave me to mourn over it alone.
[They bear off the body of Hippolito.
Enter Miranda, and Dorinda again. Ariel behind ’em.
ARIEL
I’ve bin so chid for my neglect by Prospero,
That I must now watch all and be unseen.

110

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

MIRANDA
Sister, I say agen, ’twas long of you
That all this mischief happen’d.

DORINDA
I, there’s your judgment. Your’s is the oldest
Man I ever saw except it were my Father.

DORINDA
Blame not me for your own fault, your
Curiosity brought me to see the man.

MIRANDA
Sister, no more. It is not comely in a Daughter,
When she says her Father’s old.

MIRANDA
You safely might have seen him and retir’d, but
You would needs go near him and converse, you may
Remember my Father call’d me thence, and I call’d you.

DORINDA
But why do I stay here, whilst my cold Love
Perhaps may want me?
I’le pray my Father to make yours cold too.

DORINDA
[725] That was your envy, Sister, not your love;
You call’d me thence, because you could not be
Alone with him your self; but I am sure my
Man had never gone to Heaven so soon, but
That yours made him go.

MIRANDA
[750] Sister, I’e never sleep with you agen.

[Crying.

111

DORINDA
I’le never more meet in a Bed with you,
But lodge on the bare ground and watch my Love.

MIRANDA
Sister I could not with that either of ’em shou’d
Go to Heaven without us, but it was his fortune,
And you must be satisfi’d?

MIRANDA
And at the entrance of that Cave I’le lye,
And eccho to each blast of wind a sigh.
[Exeunt severally, looking discontentedly on one another.

DORINDA
I’le not be satisfi’d: My Father says he’l make
Your man as cold as mine is now, and when he
Is made cold, my Father will not let you strive
To make him warm agen.

ARIEL
Harsh discord reigns throughout this fatal Isle,
At which good Angels mourn, ill Spirits smile;
Old Prospero, by his Daughters rob’d of rest,
Has in displeasure left ’em both unblest.
Unkindly they abjure each others bed,
To save the living, and revenge the dead.
Alonzo and his Son are Pris’ners made,
And good Gonzalo does their crimes upbraid.
Antonio and Gonzalo disagree,
And wou’d, though in one Cave, at distance be.
The Seamen all that cursed Wine have spent,
Which still renew’d their thirst of Government;
And, wanting subjects for the food of Pow’r,
Each wou’d to rule alone the rest devour.
The Monsters Sycorax and Caliban
More monstrous grow by passions learn’d from man.
Even I not fram’d of warring Elements,

MIRANDA
In spight of you mine never shall be cold.
DORINDA
I’m sure ’twas he that made me miserable,
And I will be reveng’d. Perhaps you think ’tis
Nothing to lose a man.
MIRANDA
Yes, but there is some difference betwixt
My Ferdinand, and your Hippolito.

112

Dryden and Davenant

Partake and suffer in these discontents.
Why shou’d a mortal by Enchantments hold
In chains a spirit of ætherial mould?
[775] Accursed Magick we our selves have taught,
And our own pow’r has our subjection wrought!

The Tempest

113

PROSPERO
Why do you ask that question? you know I do.

[Exit.

MIRANDA
Then you must be condemn’d for shedding his,
And he who condemns you, must dye for shedding
Yours, and that’s the way at last to leave none living.

ACT V.
Enter Prospero and Miranda.
PROSPERO
YOU beg in vain; I cannot pardon him,
He has offended Heaven.
MIRANDA
Then let Heaven punish him.
PROSPERO
It will by me.
MIRANDA
Grant him at least some respite for my sake.
PROSPERO
I by deferring Justice should incense the Deity
Against my self and you.

PROSPERO
The Argument is weak, but I want time
To let you see your errours; retire, and, if you love him,
Pray for him.

[He’s going.

MIRANDA
O stay, Sir, I have yet more Arguments.
PROSPERO
But none of any weight.
MIRANDA
Have you not said you are his Judge?
PROSPERO
[25] ’Tis true, I am; what then?

MIRANDA
et I have heard you say, The Powers above are slow
In punishing, and shou’d not you resemble them?

MIRANDA
And can you be his Executioner?
If that be so, then all men may declare their
Enemies in fault; and Pow’r without the Sword
Of Justice, will presume to punish what e’re
It calls a crime.

PROSPERO
The Powers above may pardon or reprieve,
As Sovereign Princes may dispense with Laws,
Which we, as Officers, must execute. Our Acts of grace
To Criminals are Treason to Heavens prerogative.

PROSPERO
I cannot force Gonzalo or my Brother, much
Less the Father to destroy the Son, it must
Be then the Monster Caliban, and he’s not here,
But Ariel strait shall fetch him.

MIRANDA
Do you condemn him for shedding blood?

ARIEL
My potent Lord, before thou call’st, I come,
To serve thy will.

[Enter Ariel.

114

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
Then Spirit fetch me here my salvage Slave.
ARIEL
My Lord, it does not need.
PROSPERO
Art thou then prone to mischief, wilt thou be thy self the Executioner?
ARIEL
Think better of thy aiery Minister, who
For thy sake, unbid, this night has flown
O’re almost all the habitable World.
PROSPERO
But to what purpose was all thy diligence?
ARIEL
When I was chidden by my mighty Lord for my
Neglect of young Hippolito, I went to view
His body, and soon found his soul was but retir’d,
Not sally’d out, and frighted lay at skulk in
Th’ inmost corner of his scarce-beating heart.

The Tempest
Long e’re this hour had I been back again,
But that a Storm took me returning back
And flag’d my tender Wings.
PROSPERO
Thou shalt have rest my spirit,
But hast thou search’d the wound?
ARIEL
My Lord I have, and ’twas in time I did it; for
The soul stood almost at life’s door, all bare
And naked, shivering like Boys upon a Rivers
Bank, and loth to tempt the cold air, but I took
Her and stop’d her in; and pour’d into his mouth
The healing juice of vulnerary Herbs.
PROSPERO
Thou art my faithful servant.

PROSPERO
[50] Is he not dead?

ARIEL
[75] His only danger was his loss of blood, but now
He’s wak’d, my Lord, and just this hour
He must be dress’d again, as I have done it.
Anoint the Sword which pierc’d him with this
Weapon-Salve, and wrap it close from air till
I have time to visit him again.

ARIEL
Hear me my Lord! I prun’d my wings, and, fitted for a journey, from the
next Isles of our Hesperides, I gather’d Moly first, thence shot my self to
Palestine, and watch’d the trickling Balm, which caught, I glided to the
British Isles, and there the purple Panacea found.

PROSPERO
It shall be done, be it your task, Miranda, because your
Sister is not present here, while I go visit your
Dear Ferdinand, from whom I will a while conceal
This news, that it may be more welcome.

PROSPERO
ll this to night?

MIRANDA
I obey you, and with a double duty, Sir: for now
You twice have given me life.

ARIEL
All this, my Lord, I did,
Nor was Hippolito’s good Angel wanting, who
Climbing up the circle of the Moon,
While I below got Simples for the Cure, went to
Each Planet which o’re-rul’d those Herbs,
And drew it’s virtue to increase their pow’r:

115

PROSPERO
My Ariel, follow me.
[Exeunt severally.
[Hippolito discovered on a Couch, Dorinda by him.

116

Dryden and Davenant

DORINDA
How do you find your self?
HIPPOLITO
I’m somewhat cold, can you not draw me nearer
To the Sun, I am too weak to walk?
DORINDA
My Love, I’le try.
[She draws the chair nearer the Audience.
I thought you never would have walk’d agen,
They told me you were gone away to Heaven;
Have you bin there?
HIPPOLITO
I know not where I was.
DORINDA
I will not leave you till you promise me you
Will not dye agen.
HIPPOLITO
Indeed I will not.
DORINDA
You must not go to Heav’n unless we go together,
[100] For I’ve heard my Father say that we must strive
To be each others Guide, the way to it will else
Be difficult, especially to those who are so young.
But I much wonder what it is to dye.
HIPPOLITO
Sure ’tis to dream, a kind of breathless sleep
When once the Soul’s gone out.
DORINDA
What is the Soul?
HIPPOLITO
A small blew thing that runs about within us.
DORINDA
Then I have seen it in a frosty morning run
Smoaking from my mouth.

The Tempest

HIPPOLITO
But if my soul had gone, it should have walk’d upon
A Cloud just over you, and peep’d, and thence I would have
Call’d you.
DORINDA
But I should not have heard you, ’tis so far.
HIPPOLITO
Why then I would have rain’d and snow’d upon you,
And thrown down Hail-stones gently till I hit you,
And made you look at least. But dear Dorinda
What is become of him who fought with me?
DORINDA
O, I can tell you joyful news of him,
My Father means to make him dye to day,
For what he did to you.
HIPPOLITO
That must not be, my dear Dorinda; go and beg your
Father, he may not dye, it was my fault he hurt me,
I urg’d him to it first.
DORINDA
But if he live, he’ll never leave killing you.
HIPPOLITO
[125] O no! I just remember when I fell asleep I heard
Him calling me a great way off; and crying over me as
You wou’d do, besides we have no cause of quarrel now.
DORINDA
Pray how began your difference first?
HIPPOLITO
I fought with him for all the Women in the World.
DORINDA
hat hurt you had was justly sent from Heaven,
For wishing to have any more but me.

117

118

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

HIPPOLITO
Indeed I think it was, but I repent it, the fault
Was only in my blood, for now ’tis gone, I find
I do not love so many.

MIRANDA
I cannot be unconstant, nor shou’d you.
HIPPOLITO
O my wound pains me.

DORINDA
In confidence of this, I’le beg my Father, that he
May live, I’m glad the naughty blood, that made
You love so many, is gone out.
HIPPOLITO
My Dear, go quickly, lest you come too late.
Enter Miranda at the other door, with
Hippolito’s Sword wrapt up.

119

MIRANDA
I am come to ease you.

[Exit Dor.

HIPPOLITO
Alas! I feel the cold air come to me,
My wound shoots worse than ever.

[She unwraps the Sword.

[She wipes and anoints the Sword.

MIRANDA
Does it still grieve you?

HIPPOLITO
Who’s this who looks so fair and beautiful, as
Nothing but Dorinda can surpass her? O!
I believe it is that Angel, Woman,
Whom she calls Sister.

HIPPOLITO
Now methinks there’s something laid just upon it.

MIRANDA
Sir, I am sent hither to dress your wound,
How do you find your strength?

HIPPOLITO
Yes, yes, upon the sudden all the pain
Is leaving me, sweet Heaven how I am eas’d!

HIPPOLITO
Fair Creature, I am faint with loss of blood.

MIRANDA
Do you find no ease?

Enter Ferdinand and Dorinda to them.

MIRANDA
I’m sorry for’t.

FERDINAND TO DORINDA
Madam, I must confess my life is yours,
I owe it to your generosity.

HIPPOLITO
Indeed and so am I, for if I had that blood, I then
Should find a great delight in loving you.

DORINDA
I am o’rejoy’d my Father lets you live, and proud
Of my good fortune, that he gave your life to me.

MIRANDA
But, Sir, I am anothers, and your love is given
[150] Already to my Sister.

MIRANDA
How? gave his life to her!

HIPPOLITO
et I find that if you please I can love still a little.

HIPPOLITO
las! I think she said so, and he said he ow’d it
To her generosity.

120

Dryden and Davenant

FERDINAND
But is not that your Sister with Hippolito?
DORINDA
So kind already?
FERDINAND
I came to welcome life, and I have met the
Cruellest of deaths.
HIPPOLITO
My dear Dorinda with another man?
DORINDA
Sister, what bus’ness have you here?
MIRANDA
[175] You see I dress Hippolito.
DORINDA
Y’are very charitable to a Stranger.
MIRANDA
You are not much behind in charity, to beg a pardon
For a man, whom you scarce ever saw before.
DORINDA
Henceforward let your Surgery alone, for I had
Rather he should dye, than you should cure his wound.
MIRANDA
And I wish Ferdinand had dy’d before
He ow’d his life to your entreaty.

The Tempest

121

MIRANDA
h Ferdinand! can you become inconstant?
If I must lose you, I had rather death should take
You from me than you take your self.
FERDINAND
And if I might have chose, I would have wish’d
That death from Prospero, and not this from you.
DORINDA
I, now I find why I was sent away,
That you might have my Sisters company.
HIPPOLITO
Dorinda, kill me not with your unkindness,
This is too much, first to be false your self,
And then accuse me too.
FERDINAND
We all accuse each other, and each one denys their guilt,
I should be glad it were a mutual errour.
And therefore first to clear my self from fault,
[200] Madam, I beg your pardon, while I say I only love
Your Sister.
MIRANDA
O blest word!
I’m sure I love no man but Ferdinand.
DORINDA
Nor I, Heav’n knows, but my Hippolito.

FERDINAND TO HIPPOLITO
Sir, I’m glad you are so well recover’d, you
Keep your humour still to have all Women.

HIPPOLITO
I never knew I lov’d so much, before I fear’d
Dorinda’s constancy; but now I am convinc’d that
I lov’d none but her, because none else can
Recompence her loss.

HIPPOLITO
Not all, Sir, you except one of the number,
Your new Love there, Dorinda.

FERDINAND
’Twas happy then you had this little tryal.
But how we all so much mistook, I know not.

[To Dorinda.

122

Dryden and Davenant

MIRANDA
I have only this to say in my defence: my Father sent
Me hither, to attend the wounded Stranger.
DORINDA
And Hippolito sent me to beg the life of Ferdinand.
FERDINAND
From such small errours, left at first unheeded,
Have often sprung sad accidents in love:
But see, our Fathers and our friends are come
To mix their joys with ours.
Enter Prospero, Alonzo, Antonio, Gonzalo.
ALONZO TO PROSPERO
Let it no more be thought of, your purpose
Though it was severe was just. In losing Ferdinand
I should have mourn’d, but could not have complain’d.
PROSPERO
Sir, I am glad kind Heaven decreed it otherwise.
DORINDA
O wonder!
How many goodly Creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is!
HIPPOLITO
[225] O brave new World that has such people in’t!
ALONZO TO FERDINAND
Now all the blessings of a glad Father
Compass thee about,
And make thee happy in thy beauteous choice.
GONZALO
I’ve inward wept, or should have spoke e’re this.
Look down sweet Heav’n, and on this Couple drop
A blessed Crown, for it is you chalk’d out the
Way which brought us hither.

The Tempest
ANTONIO
Though penitence forc’d by necessity can scarce
Seem real, yet dearest Brother I have hope
My blood may plead for pardon with you, I resign
Dominion, which ’tis true I could not keep,
But Heaven knows too I would not.
PROSPERO
ll past crimes I bury in the joy of this
Blessed day.
ALONZO
And that I may not be behind in justice, to this
Young Prince I render back his Dukedom,
And as the Duke of Mantua thus salute him.
HIPPOLITO
What is it that you render back, methinks
You give me nothing.
PROSPERO
You are to be Lord of a great People,
And o’re Towns and Cities.
HIPPOLITO
And shall these people be all Men and Women?
GONZALO
Yes, and shall call you Lord.
HIPPOLITO
Why then I’le live no longer in a Prison, but
[250] Have a whole Cave to my self hereafter.
PROSPERO
And that your happiness may be compleat,
I give you my Dorinda for your Wife, she shall
Be yours for ever, when the Priest has made you one.
HIPPOLITO
How can he make us one, shall I grow to her?

123

124

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
By saying holy words you shall be joyn’d in marriage
To each other.
DORINDA
I warrant you those holy words are charms.
My Father means to conjure us together.
PROSPERO TO HIS DAUGHTER
My Ariel told me, when last night you quarrel’d,
You said you would for ever part your beds,
But what you threaten’d in your anger, Heaven
Has turn’d to Prophecy.
For you, Miranda, must with Ferdinand,
And you, Dorinda, with Hippolito lye in
One Bed hereafter.
ALONZO
And Heaven make those Beds still fruitful in
Producing Children to bless their Parents
Youth, and Grandsires age.
MIRANDA TO DORINDA
If Children come by lying in a Bed, I wonder you
And I had none between us.
DORINDA
Sister it was our fault, we meant like fools
To look ’em in the fields, and they it seems
Are only found in Beds.
HIPPOLITO
I am o’rejoy’d that I shall have Dorinda in a Bed,
[275] We’ll lye all night and day together there,
And never rise again.
FERDINAND ASIDE TO HIM
Hippolito! you yet are ignorant of your great
Happiness, but there is somewhat which for
Your own and fair Dorinda’s sake I must instruct
You in.

The Tempest

125

HIPPOLITO
Pray teach me quickly how Men and Women in your
World make love, I shall soon learn
I warrant you.
[Enter Ariel driving in Steph. Trinc. Must. Vent. Calib. Syc.
PROSPERO
Why that’s my dainty Ariel, I shall miss thee,
But yet thou shalt have freedom.
GONZALO
O look, Sir, look the Master and the Saylors—
The Bosen too—my Prophecy is out, that if
A Gallows were on land, that man could n’ere
Be drown’d.
ALONZO TO TRINCALO
Now Blasphemy, what not one Oath ashore?
Hast thou no mouth by land? why star’st thou so?
TRINCALO
What more Dukes yet, I must resign my Dukedom,
But ’tis no matter, I was almost starv’d in’t.
MUSTACHO
Here’s nothing but wild Sallads without Oyl or Vinegar.
STEPHANO
The Duke and Prince alive! would I had now our gallant Ship agen, and
were her Master, I’d willingly give all my Island for her.
VENTOSO
And I my Vice-Roy-ship.
TRINCALO
I shall need no hangman, for I shall e’en hang
[300] My self, now my friend Butt has shed his
Last drop of life. Poor Butt is quite departed.
ANTONIO
They talk like mad men.

126

Dryden and Davenant

PROSPERO
No matter, time will bring ’em to themselves, and
Now their Wine is gone they will not quarrel.
Your Ship is safe and tight, and bravely rigg’d,
As when you first set Sail.
ALONZO
This news is wonderful.

The Tempest

PROSPERO
[325] When the morn draws I’le bring you to your Ship,
And promise you calm Seas and happy Gales.
My Ariel, that’s thy charge: then to the Elements
Be free, and fare thee well.
ARIEL
I’le do it Master.

ARIEL
Was it well done, my Lord?
PROSPERO
Rarely, my diligence.
GONZALO
But pray, Sir, what are those mishapen Creatures?
PROSPERO
Their Mother was a Witch, and one so strong
She would controul the Moon, make Flows
And Ebbs, and deal in her command without
Her power.
SYCORAX
O Setebos! these be brave Sprights indeed.
PROSPERO TO CALIBAN
Go Sirrah to my Cell, and as you hope for
Pardon, trim it up.
CALIBAN
Most carefully. I will be wise hereafter.
What a dull fool was I to take those Drunkards
For Gods, when such as these were in the world?
PROSPERO
Sir, I invite your Highness and your Train
To my poor Cave this night; a part of which
I will imploy in telling you my story.
ALONZO
No doubt it must be strangely taking, Sir.

127

Sings.
Where the Bee sucks there suck I,
In a Cowslips Bell, I lye,
There I couch when Owls do cry,
On the Swallows wing I flye
After Summer merrily.
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the Blossom that hangs on the Bough.
SYCORAX
I’le to Sea with thee, and keep thee warm in thy Cabin.
TRINCALO
No my dainty Dy-dapper, you have a tender constitution, and will be sick
a Ship-board. You are partly Fish and may swim after me. I wish you a good
Voyage.
PROSPERO
Now to this Royal Company, my servant, be visible,
And entertain them with a Dance before they part.
ARIEL
I have a gentle Spirit for my Love,
Who twice seven years hath waited for my Freedom,
It shall appear and foot it featly with me.
Milcha, my Love, thy Ariel calls thee.
MILCHA
Here!
PROSPERO
Henceforth this Isle to the afflicted be

[Enter Milcha.

[They dance a Saraband.

Dryden and Davenant

The Tempest

A place of Refuge as it was to me;
[350] The Promises of blooming Spring live here,
And all the Blessings of the rip’ning year;
On my retreat let Heaven and Nature smile,
And ever flourish the Enchanted Isle.

Epilogue.

[Exeunt.

Gallants, by all good signs it does appear,
That Sixty Seven’s a very damning year,
For Knaves abroad, and for ill Poets here.
Among the Muses there’s a gen’ral rot,
The Rhyming Mounsieur and the Spanish Plot:
Defic or Court, all’s one, they go to Pot.
The Ghosts of Poets walk within this place,
And haunt us Actors wheresoe’re we pass,
In Visions bloodier than King Richard’s was.
For this poor wretch he has not much to say,
But quietly brings in his part o’th’ Play,
And begs the favour to be damn’d to day.
He sends me only like a Sh’riffs man here
To let you know the Malefactor’s neer;
And that he means to dye, en Cavalier.
For if you shou’d be gracious to his Pen,
Th’ Example will prove ill to other men,
And you’ll be troubled with ’em all agen.
FINIS.
